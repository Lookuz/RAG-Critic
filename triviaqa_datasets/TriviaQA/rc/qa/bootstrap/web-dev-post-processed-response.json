Richard's naked body was then carried back to Leicester tied to a horse, and early sources strongly suggest that it was displayed in the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke, prior to being buried at Greyfriars Church in Leicester.  In 1495, Henry VII paid \u00a350 for a marble and alabaster monument. According to a discredited tradition, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his body was thrown into the River Soar, although other evidence suggests that a memorial stone was visible in 1612, in a garden built on the site of Greyfriars. The exact location was then lost, owing to more than 400 years of subsequent development, until archaeological investigations in 2012 revealed the site of the garden and Greyfriars church. There was a memorial ledger stone in the choir of the cathedral, since replaced by the tomb of the king, and a stone plaque on Bow Bridge where tradition had falsely suggested that his remains had been thrown into the river.\n\n### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n1. Richard III was king of England for 2 years, from 1483 until his death in 1485.\n2. Richard's body was displayed in the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke before being buried at Greyfriars Church in Leicester.\n3.

An improved response could be:\n\nOperation Felix was the codename for a proposed German invasion of Gibraltar during World War II, which was never carried out due to Spanish dictator Francisco Franco's intransigence. The operation involved the German Air Force, Navy, and Army, as well as the Italian Air Force and frogmen unit, and was intended to disrupt British naval movement and control the strategic location. Despite the postponement and modification of the operation, it was ultimately abandoned due to Franco's refusal to commit Spain to the Axis side."

        "refined": ". Dr. Pangloss. (1 word)\n\n### CONTEXT:\nTranslating Association into modifiability \n\nIt should be noted that research to date has demonstrated that optimists are less likely to have certain diseases or develop certain diseases over time. By comparison, research has not yet been able to demonstrate the ability to change an individual's level of optimism through psychological intervention, and thereby alter the course of disease or likelihood for development of disease. Though in that same vein, an article by Mayo Clinic argues steps to change self-talk from negative to positive may shift individuals from a negative to a more positive/optimistic outlook.  Strategies claimed to be of value include surrounding oneself with positive people, identifying areas of change, practicing positive self-talk, being open to humor, and following a healthy lifestyle.\n\nPhilosophical optimism\n\nDistinct from a disposition to believe that things will work out, there is a philosophical idea that, perhaps in ways that may not be fully comprehended, the present moment is in an optimum state. This is referred to as panglossian-ism.  This view that all of nature - past, present and future - operates by laws of optimization along the lines of Hamilton's principle in the realm of physics is countered by views such as idealism, realism, and philosophical pessimism. Philosophers often link the concept of optimism with the name of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who held that we live in the best of all possible worlds, or that God created a physical universe that applies the laws of physics. This idea was famously mocked by Voltaire in his satirical novel Candide as baseless optimism of the sort exemplified by the beliefs of Pangloss from Voltaire's Candide, which are the opposite of his fellow traveller Martin's pessimism and emphasis on free will. The phrase \"panglossian pessimism\" has been used to describe the pessimistic position that, since this is the best of all possible worlds, it is impossible for anything to get any better.\nRoles\n\n* Candide (tenor)\n* Pangloss (baritone; doubles with Martin in the 1956 stage version and Bernstein's",

        "refined": "Fencing is the sport that uses the terms \"plastron,\" \"piste,\" and \"riposte.\" A plastron is the protective jacket worn by fencers, the piste is the playing area, and a riposte is a quick counterattack.\n\n### CONTEXT:\nIn modern fencing, the piste or strip is the playing area. Regulations require the piste to be 14 meters long and between 1.5 and 2 meters wide. The last two meters on each end are hash-marked to warn a fencer before he/she backs off the end of the strip, after which is a 1.5 to 2 meter runoff. The piste is also marked at the center and at the \"en garde\" lines, located two meters either side of the center line.\n\nRetreating off the end of the strip with both feet results in a touch awarded for the opponent. Going off the side of the strip with one or both feet halts the fencing action, and is penalized by allowing the opponent to advance one meter before being replaced on guard. If the offending fencer would then be replaced behind the rear limit of the strip because of this, a touch is awarded to the opponent. If play is halted for any reason other than stepping off the side of the piste, a fencer may never be replaced on guard behind the rear line.\n\nAfter each touch, fencers begin again at the en garde line, 4 meters apart, or if these lines are not available, roughly at a position where their blades can nearly touch when fully extended. If no touch is scored but play was halted, the fencers come en garde at the position they were stopped.\n\nMost pistes at fencing tournaments are \"grounded\" to the scoring box, thus any hits that a fencer makes against the piste will not be registered as a touch.\n\nTypes of piste\n\nThere are different types of piste:\n\n1. Rubber conductive piste\nMade from conductive material with a rubber back; lightweight, approximately 25 kg.\n\n2. Aluminum section piste\nMade from sections of rolled aluminum which are bolted together; weighs approximately 300 kg\n\n3. Met",

        "refined": ".\n\n### CONTEXT\nIn the first century BC, both paideia and philanthr\u00f4p\u00eda were translated into Latin by the single word humanitas, which was also understood to be the core of liberal education studia humanitatis, the studies of humanity, or simply \"the humanities.\" In the second century AD, Plutarch used the concept of philanthr\u00f4p\u00eda to describe superior human beings. This Classically synonymous troika, of philanthropy, the humanities, and liberal education, declined with the replacement of the classical world by Christianity. During the Middle Ages, philanthr\u00f4p\u00eda was superseded by caritas charity, selfless love, valued for salvation. Philanthropy was modernized by Sir Francis Bacon in the 1600s, who is largely credited with preventing the word from being owned by horticulture. Bacon considered philanthr\u00f4p\u00eda to be synonymous with \"goodness\", which correlated with the Aristotelian conception of virtue, as consciously instilled habits of good behavior.  Then in the 1700s, an influential lexical figurehead by the name of Samuel Johnson simply defined philanthropy as \"love of mankind; good nature\".  This definition still survives today and is often cited more gender-neutrally as the \"love of humanity.\" However, it was Noah Webster who would more accurately reflect the word usage in American English. \n\nThe precise meaning of philanthropy is still a matter of some contention, its definition being largely dependent on the particular interests of the writer employing the term. Nevertheless, there are some working definitions to which the community associated with the field of \"philanthropic studies\" most commonly subscribes. One of the more widely accepted of these is the one employed by Lester Salamon, who defines philanthropy as \"the private giving of time or valuables (money, security, property) for public purposes; and/or one form of income of private non-profit organizations\".\n\nHistory\n\nClassical philanthropy\n\n### QUESTION:\nAmerican businessman and philanthropist Solomon Guggenheim (1861-1949) established a famous eponymous international network of?\n\n##",

Biographer Bragg observed that Look Back in Anger \"had defined a generation, provided a watershed in Britain's view of itself and brought [Osborne] into the public prints as a controversial, dangerous figure.\" Burton was able to identify himself with Porter, finding it \"fascinating to find a man who came presumably from my sort of class, who actually could talk the way I would like to talk.\" The film and Burton's performance received mixed reviews upon release.   Biographer Alpert noted that though reviews in the UK were favourable, those in the United States were more negative. Crowther wrote of Burton: \"His tirades are eloquent but tiring, his breast beatings are dramatic but dull and his occasional lapses into sadness are pathetic but endurable.\"  Both Geoff Andrew of Time Out magazine and Schwartz felt Burton was too old for the part,   and the Variety reviewer thought \"the role gives him little opportunity for variety.\"  Contemporary reviews for the film have been better and it has a rating of 89% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.  Look Back in Anger is now considered one of the defining films of the British New Wave cinema, a movement from the late 1950s to the late 1960s in which working-class characters became the focus of the film and conflict of social classes a central theme.  Jimmy Porter is also considered as one of Burton's best on-screen roles; he was nominated in the Best Actor categories at the BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards but lost to Peter Sellers for I'm All Right Jack (1959) and Anthony Franciosa for Career (1959) respectively.

        "refined": ", Ludwig van Beethoven\n\n### CONTEXT:\nIn the years after 1800, the music developed by Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short motifs, developed organically, came to replace melody as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his Fifth Symphony). Later Romantic composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, and Gustav Mahler used more unusual chords and more dissonance to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic chromatic alterations of tonality, such as extended chords and altered chords, which created new sound \"colours\". Composers in the Romantic era increased the size of the orchestra by adding players and using new instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Some Wagnerian orchestras included multiple harps, massive string sections and Wagner tubas.\n\n20th- and 21st-century music\nThe four-movement form that emerged from this evolution was as follows:  \n# an opening sonata or allegro\n# a slow movement, such as adagio\n# a minuet or scherzo with trio\n# an allegro, rondo, or sonata\n\nVariations on this layout, like changing the order of the middle movements or adding a slow introduction to the first movement, were common. Haydn, Mozart and their contemporaries restricted their use of the four-movement form to orchestral or multi-instrument chamber music such as quartets, though since Beethoven solo sonatas are as often written in four as in three movements. \n\nThe composition of early symphonies was centred on Milan, Vienna, and Mannheim. The Milanese school centred around Giovanni Battista Sammartini and included Antonio Brioschi, Ferdinando Galimberti and Giovanni Battista Lampugnani. Early exponents of the form in Vienna included Georg Christoph Wagenseil, Wenzel Raimund Birck and Georg Matthias Monn, while later significant Viennese composers of symphonies included Johann Baptist Wanhal, Karl Ditters von Dit",

For example, the RESPONSE could explain how Pitt's introduction of income tax was a significant innovation at the time, as it was a new way of raising revenue for the government. Additionally, the RESPONSE could provide more information about the structure of the income tax, such as the rates and thresholds applied to different income brackets. By providing more context and detail, the IMPROVED RESPONSE can help readers better understand the significance of Pitt's innovation and its impact on British history.",
        "refined_keywords": "What innovation was introduced to Britain by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger in 1798?\n\nIn 1798, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger introduced a groundbreaking innovation to Britain: income tax. Prior to this, the government relied on customs duties and excise taxes to raise revenue. However, as the British Empire expanded and the cost of wars with France grew, Pitt recognized the need for a more sustainable and equitable method of taxation. He successfully lobbied Parliament to pass the Income Tax Act, which imposed a flat rate of 2 shillings (about $1.50 in today's currency) on all income above $100 per year. This was a significant innovation at the time, as it marked the first time a government had directly taxed individuals based on their income. The structure of the income tax, with its graduated rates and thresholds, has remained largely unchanged to this day and has become a cornerstone of modern taxation systems."

Ragtime, which emerged in the 1890s, was a key precursor to jazz, and African-American communities in St. Louis and other cities played a crucial role in its development. Morton's contribution to the genre was significant, but it is not accurate to say that he invented jazz outright in 1902. A more nuanced understanding of the history of jazz recognizes the interplay between various musical traditions and cultural influences that shaped the genre over time.",

The small intestine is responsible for the breakdown and absorption of nutrients from food, and it is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.

The ileum is the last part of the small intestine, and it is where the remaining nutrients are absorbed before entering the large intestine.\n\n### REFERENCES:\n\n1. Guyton, A. C., & Hall, J. E.

European silver flowed into China when the Canton System, instituted in the mid-17th century, confined the sea trade to Canton and to the Chinese merchants of the Thirteen Factories. The British East India Company had a matching monopoly of British trade. The British East India Company began to auction opium grown on its plantations in India to independent foreign traders in exchange for silver. The opium was then transported to the Chinese coast and sold to local middlemen who retailed the drug inside China. This reverse flow of silver and the increasing numbers of opium addicts alarmed Chinese officials.\n\nIn 1839, the Daoguang Emperor, rejecting proposals to legalise and tax opium, appointed viceroy Lin Zexu to solve the problem by abolishing the trade. Lin confiscated around 20,000 chests of opium (approximately 1210\u00a0tons or 2.66\u00a0million\u00a0pounds) without offering compensation, blockaded trade, and confined foreign merchants to their quarters.  The British government, although not officially denying China's right to control imports of the drug, objected to this unexpected seizure and used its naval and gunnery power to inflict a quick and decisive defeat, a tactic later referred",

The origins of Mornay sauce can be traced back to the 18th century, when it was first popularized by French chefs. Today, it remains a staple of French cuisine and is often served with dishes like gratins, casseroles, and pasta bakes."

Here's an improved response:\n\nWerner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot both be precisely determined at the same time. This principle was first introduced by Heisenberg in 1927 and has been widely accepted and used in the field ever since. The principle is based on the idea that the act of measuring the position of a particle will inherently disturb its momentum, and vice versa. This means that the more precisely the position of a particle is measured, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. The uncertainty principle has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level and has led to many important discoveries and innovations in the field of physics.",

A popular 18th century nursery rhyme is There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe. This story tells about an old woman living in a shoe with a lot of children. In 1948, Mahlon Haines, a shoe salesman in Hallam, Pennsylvania, built an actual house shaped like a work boot as a form of advertisement. The Haines Shoe House was rented to newlyweds and the elderly until his death in 1962. Since then, it has served as an ice cream parlor, a bed and breakfast, and a museum. It still stands today and is a popular roadside attraction. \n\nShoes also play an important role in the fairy tales Cinderella and The Red Shoes. In the movie adaption of the children's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, a pair of red ruby slippers play a key role in the plot. The 1985 comedy The Man with One Red Shoe features an eccentric man wearing one normal business shoe and one red shoe that becomes central to the plot.\n\nAthletic sneaker collection has also existed as a part of urban subculture in the United States for several decades.  Recent decades have seen this trend spread to European nations such as the Czech Republic.  A Sneakerhead is a person who owns multiple pairs of shoes as a form of collection and fashion. A contributor to the growth of sneaker collecting is the continued worldwide popularity of the Air Jordan line of sneakers designed by Nike for Basketball star Michael Jordan.\n\nIn the Holy Bible's Old Testament, the shoe is used to symbolize something that is worthless or of little value. In the New Testament, the act of removing one's shoes symbolizes servitude. Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples regarded the act of removing their shoes as a mark of reverence when approaching a sacred person or place.  In the Book of Exodus, Moses was instructed to remove his shoes before approaching the burning bush:",
