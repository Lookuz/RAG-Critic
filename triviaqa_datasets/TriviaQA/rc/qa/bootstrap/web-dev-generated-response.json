    "question": "Who was the next British Prime Minister after Arthur Balfour?",
    "answer": "Campbell-Bannerman",
    "evidence": "It has also been common for Prime Ministers to be granted a peerage upon retirement from the Commons, which elevates the individual to the House of Lords. Formerly, the peerage bestowed was usually an earldom (which was always hereditary), with Churchill offered a dukedom.  However, since the 1960s, hereditary peerages have generally been eschewed, and life peerages have been preferred, although in 1984 Harold Macmillan was created Earl of Stockton. Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher accepted life peerages, although Douglas-Home had previously disclaimed his hereditary title as Earl of Home. Edward Heath, John Major and Tony Blair did not accept peerages of any kind, although Heath and Major were later appointed as Knights of the Garter. Gordon Brown remained a member of parliament until the 2015 general election, and has not, to date, accepted a peerage.\n\nLiving former Prime Ministers\n\nAs of , there are four living former Prime Ministers, as seen below.\n\nFile:JMajor.JPG|Sir John Majorserved 1990\u201397born 1943 (age )\nFile:WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM ANNUAL MEETING 2009 - Tony Blair.jpg|Tony Blairserved 1997\u20132007born 1953 (age )\nFile:Accelerating Infrastructure Development Gordon Brown (8412051140).jpg|Gordon Brownserved 2007\u201310born 1951 (age )\nFile:Prime Minister David Cameron (5570842655).jpg|David Cameron MPserved 2010\u201316born 1966 (age )\nBalfour remained important in the party, however, and when the Unionists joined Asquith's coalition government in May 1915, Balfour succeeded Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty. When Asquith's government collapsed in December 1916, Balfour, who seemed a potential successor to the premiership, became Foreign Secretary in Lloyd George's new administration, but not in the small War Cabinet, and was frequently left out of inner workings of government. Balfour's service as Foreign Secretary was notable for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter to Lord Rothschild promising the Jews a \"national home\" in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nBalfour resigned as Foreign Secretary following the Versailles Conference in 1919, but continued in the government (and the Cabinet after normal peacetime political arrangements resumed) as Lord President of the Council. In 1921\u201322 he represented the British Empire at the Washington Naval Conference and during summer 1922 stood in for the Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, who was ill. He put proposed for an international settlement of war debts and reparations, called the Balfour Note, but met an unfavourable response.\n\nIn 1922 he, with most of the Conservative leadership, resigned with Lloyd George's government following the Conservative back-bench revolt against continuance of the coalition. Bonar Law became Prime Minister. On 5 May 1922, Balfour was created Earl of Balfour and Viscount Thaprain, 'of\nWhittingehame, in the county of Haddington.'  Like many Coalition leaders, he did not hold office in the Conservative governments of 1922\u20134, but as an elder statesman, he was consulted by the King in the choice of Baldwin as Bonar Law's successor as Conservative leader in May 1923. When asked whether \"dear George\" (the much more experienced Lord Curzon) would be chosen, he replied, referring to Curzon's wealthy wife Grace, \"No, dear, George will not but he will still have the means of Grace.\"",

In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier's recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs.  The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, and none of her renderings of 20th-century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. Only a small part of her St John Passion was captured on disc. \n\nThe recording of the unaccompanied  Northumbrian folk song \"Blow the Wind Southerly\", initially made by Decca in 1949, has been reissued many times and frequently played on radio  in shows such as Desert Island Discs, Housewives' Choice and Your Hundred Best Tunes.   Another signature aria, first recorded in 1944 and on numerous subsequent occasions, is \"What is life?\" (Che far\u00f2) from   Orfeo ed Euridice.

We sat and talked about where our families came from, and discovered that we were from the same family... but I'm not exactly sure what our relation is... It was she who later said that she was my cousin, I didn't say that\". Her parents divorced when she was five; she later took the Romanian form of her mother's last name, Bacall.  She no longer saw her father and formed a very close bond with her mother, who remarried to Lee Goldberg and came to live in California after Bacall became a movie star.  \n\nEarly career and modeling\n\nIn 1941 Bacall took lessons at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where she was classmates with Kirk Douglas,  while working as a theatre usher at the St. James Theatre and fashion model.\n\nShe made her acting debut on Broadway in 1942, at age 17, as a walk-on in Johnny 2 X 4.

    "evidence": "The Bad World Tour began on September 12 that year, finishing on January 14, 1989.  In Japan alone, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people, nearly tripling the previous record of 200,000 in a single tour.  Jackson broke a Guinness World Record when 504,000 people attended seven sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium.  He performed a total of 123 concerts to an audience of 4.4 million people. \n\nIn 1988, Jackson released his only autobiography, Moonwalk, which took four years to complete and sold 200,000 copies.  He wrote about his childhood, the Jackson 5, and the abuse he had suffered.  He also wrote about his changing facial appearance, attributing it to puberty, weight loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hair style, and stage lighting. Moonwalk reached the top position on The New York Times best sellers' list.  Jackson released a film, Moonwalker, which featured live footage and short films starring Jackson and Joe Pesci. Due to financial issues, the film was only released theatrically in Germany; in other markets it was released direct-to-video. It debuted at the top of the Billboard Top Music Video Cassette chart, staying there for 22 weeks. It was eventually knocked off the top spot by Michael Jackson: The Legend Continues. \n\nIn March 1988, Jackson purchased land near Santa Ynez, California, to build Neverland Ranch at a cost of $17 million.  He installed several carnival rides on the 2700 acre property, including a Ferris wheel, carousel, menagerie, as well as a movie theater and a zoo.  A security staff of 40 patrolled the grounds. In 2003, it was valued at approximately $100 million.  In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at $125 million for that year alone.

    "question": "Which volcano in Tanzania is the highest mountain in Africa?",
    "answer": "Kilimanjaro",
    "evidence": "Tanzania,This approximates the Kiswahili pronunciation. However, is also heard in English. officially the United Republic of Tanzania (), is a large country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania.\n\nTanzania's population of 51.82 million (2014)  is diverse, composed of several ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups. Tanzania is a presidential constitutional republic, and since 1996, its official capital city has been Dodoma, where the President's Office, the National Assembly, and some government ministries are located.  Dar es Salaam, the former capital, retains most government offices and is the country's largest city, principal port, and leading commercial centre. \n\nEuropean colonialism began in mainland Tanzania during the late 19th century when Germany formed German East Africa, which gave way to British rule following World War I. The mainland was governed as Tanganyika, with the Zanzibar Archipelago remaining a separate colonial jurisdiction. Following their respective independence in 1961 and 1963, the two entities merged in April 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanzania. \n\nEtymology\n\nThe name \"Tanzania\" was created as a clipped compound of the names of the two states that unified to create the country: Tanganyika and Zanzibar. \n\nThe name \"Tanganyika\" is derived from the Swahili words tanga (\"sail\") and nyika (\"uninhabited plain\", \"wilderness\"), creating the phrase \"sail in the wilderness\". It is sometimes understood as a reference to Lake Tanganyika. \n\nThe name of Zanzibar comes from \"zengi\", the name for a local people (said to mean \"black\"), and the Arabic word \"barr\", which means coast or shore. \n\nHistory\n\nPre-colonial\nMount Kilimanjaro,  with its three volcanic cones, \"Kibo\", \"Mawenzi\", and \"Shira\", is a dormant volcano in Tanzania. It is the highest mountain in Africa, and rises approximately 4,900 m (16,000 ft) from its base to  above sea level. The first recorded ascent to the summit of the mountain was by Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller in 1889. The mountain is part of the Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major climbing destination. The mountain has been the subject of many scientific studies because of its shrinking glaciers.\n\nGeology and physical features\n\nKilimanjaro rises approximately 4,900 m (16,000 ft) from its southern base in the plains near the municipality of Moshi to its summit height of 5895 m.  Kilimanjaro is the highest volcano outside South America. \n\nKilimanjaro is a large stratovolcano and is composed of three distinct volcanic cones: Kibo, the highest; Mawenzi at ;  and Shira, the shortest at .  Mawenzi and Shira are extinct, while Kibo is dormant and could erupt again. \n\nUhuru Peak is the highest summit on Kibo's crater rim. The Tanzania National Parks Authority, a governmental agency,  and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization list the height of Uhuru Peak as . That height is based on a British Ordnance Survey in 1952.  Since then, the height has been measured as  in 1999,  in 2008, and  in 2014.\n\nThe interior of the volcanic edifice is poorly known, given the lack of large scale erosion that could have exposed the interiors of the volcano.",

    "question": "The flag of Libya is a plain rectangle of which color?",
    "answer": "Green",
    "evidence": "The flag of Libya was originally introduced in 1951, following the creation of the Kingdom of Libya. It was designed by Omar Faiek Shennib and approved by King Idris Al Senussi who comprised the UN delegation representing the regions of Cyrenaica, Fezzan and Tripolitania at UN unification discussions.\n\nThe flag fell out of use in 1969, but was subsequently adopted by the National Transitional Council and anti-Gaddafi forces and effectively reinstated as the country\u2019s national flag in article three of the Libyan Draft Constitutional Charter for the Transitional\u00a0Stage issued on 3 August 2011.\n\nOrigin of the flag of Libya\n\nOmar Faiek Shennib, Chief of the Royal Diwans, Vice President of the National Assembly and Minister of Defense under King Idris Al Senussi is credited in the memoirs of Adrian Pelt, UN commissioner for Libya (1949 to 1951) for the design of the original flag of Libya. This flag represented Libya from its independence in 1951 to 1969, and was adopted by the pro-democracy movement during the Libyan civil war.\n\nAn excerpt from the memoirs of Adrian Pelt states, \"during deliberations of the Libyan National Constitutional Convention, a paper drawing of a proposed national flag was presented to the convention by Omar Faiek Shennib (distinguished member of the delegation from Cyrenaica). The design was composed of three colors; red, black and green, with a white Crescent and Star centered in the middle black stripe. Mr. Shennib informed the delegates that this design had met the approval of His Highness Emir of Cyrenaica, King Idris Al Senussi (later to become King of Libya). The assembly subsequently approved that design.\"\nSome complex flag designs are not intended for through and through implementation, requiring separate obverse and reverse sides if made correctly. In these cases there is a design element (usually text) which is not symmetric and should be read in the same direction, regardless of whether the hoist is to the viewer's left or right. These cases can be divided into two types:\n#The same (asymmetric) design may be duplicated on both sides. Such flags can be manufactured by creating two identical through and through flags and then sewing them back to back, though this can affect the resulting combination's responsiveness to the wind. Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol , indicating the reverse is congruent to (rather than a mirror image of) the obverse.\n#Rarely, the reverse design may differ, in whole or in part, from that of the obverse. Examples of flags whose reverse differs from the obverse include the flag of Paraguay, the flag of Oregon, and the historical flag of the Soviet Union. Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol .\n\nCommon designs on flags include crosses, stripes, and divisions of the surface, or field, into bands or quarters\u2014patterns and principles mainly derived from heraldry. A heraldic coat of arms may also be flown as a banner of arms, as is done on both the state flag of Maryland and the flag of Kiribati.\n\nThe de jure flag of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi, which consisted of a rectangular field of green, was for a long period the only national flag using a single colour and no design or insignia. However, other historical states have also used flags without designs or insignia, such as the Soviet Republic of Hungary, whose flag was a plain field of red.\n\nColours are normally described with common names, such as \"red\", but may be further specified using colourimetry.",

The story and emotional content of a musical\u00a0\u2013 humor, pathos, love, anger\u00a0\u2013 are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals.\n\nAlthough music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America.  These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan. The Princess Theatre musicals and other smart shows like Of Thee I Sing (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat (1927) and Oklahoma! (1943).

In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd with drummer Nick Mason, keyboardist Rick Wright and guitarist, singer, and songwriter Syd Barrett. Waters initially served as the group's bassist, but following the departure of Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist, conceptual leader and co-lead vocalist. Waters had the 9th widest vocal range on a list of over 150 contemporary Rock & Pop singers, with a total range of B1-C7, with the magazine commenting \"He's not a tenor, he's a mutation.\"  \n\nPink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling acts in the history of popular music; as of 2013, they have sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences within the group, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their intended use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years passed before he performed with them again.\nThe other key focus for British blues was around John Mayall who formed the Bluesbreakers, whose members included Eric Clapton (after his departure from The Yardbirds) and later Peter Green. Particularly significant was the release of Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (Beano) album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings and the sound of which was much emulated in both Britain and the United States.  Eric Clapton went on to form supergroups Cream, Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominos, followed by an extensive solo career that helped bring blues rock into the mainstream. Green, along with the Bluesbreaker's rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, formed Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, who enjoyed some of the greatest commercial success in the genre. In the late 1960s Jeff Beck, also an alumnus of the Yardbirds, moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, the Jeff Beck Group. The last Yardbirds guitarist was Jimmy Page, who went on to form The New Yardbirds which rapidly became Led Zeppelin. Many of the songs on their first three albums, and occasionally later in their careers, were expansions on traditional blues songs.",

    "question": "Which was the only eastern bloc country to participate in the 1984 LA Olympics?",
    "answer": "Rumania",
    "evidence": "In that same month, annihilation of the opposition in Bulgaria began on the basis of continuing instructions by Soviet cadres.  At a late September 1947 meeting of all communist parties in Szklarska Por\u0119ba,  Eastern Bloc communist parties were blamed for permitting even minor influence by non-communists in their respective countries during the run up to the Marshall Plan.\n\nBerlin blockade and airlift\n\nIn former German capital Berlin, surrounded by Soviet-occupied Germany, Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in West Berlin.  The blockade was caused, in part, by early local elections of October 1946 in which the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) was rejected in favor of the Social Democratic Party, which had gained two and a half times more votes than the SED.   The United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began a massive \"Berlin airlift\", supplying West Berlin with food and other supplies. \n\nThe Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the western policy change and communists attempted to disrupt the elections of 1948 preceding large losses therein,  while 300,000 Berliners demonstrated and urged the international airlift to continue.  In May 1949, Stalin lifted the blockade, permitting the resumption of Western shipments to Berlin.  \n\nTito\u2013Stalin split\n\nAfter disagreements between Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito and the Soviet Union regarding Greece and Albania, a Tito\u2013Stalin split occurred, followed by Yugoslavia being expelled from the Cominform in June 1948 and a brief failed Soviet putsch in Belgrade.   The split created two separate communist forces in Europe.  A vehement campaign against Titoism was immediately started in the Eastern Bloc, describing agents of both the West and Tito in all places engaging in subversive activity.\nThe 1984 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXIII Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event held in Los Angeles, California, United States in 1984. When Tehran, the only other interested city on the international level, declined to bid due to the concurrent Iranian political and social changes, the IOC awarded Los Angeles the Games by default. This was the second occasion Los Angeles hosted the games, the first being in 1932.\n\nIn response to the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, 14 Eastern Bloc countries, including the Soviet Union, Cuba and East Germany, boycotted the Games; only Romania elected to attend. For differing reasons, Iran and Libya also boycotted. The USSR announced its intention not to participate on May 8, 1984, citing security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\"  Boycotting countries organized another large event in June\u2013September 1984, called the Friendship Games; however, not even a single competition was held between July 28 and August 12. Representatives of the organizing countries, the Soviets in particular, underlined it was \"not held to replace the Olympics\". Elite athletes from the U.S. and USSR would only compete against each other at the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, organized in response to the boycotts.\n\nWhere ambitious construction for the 1976 games in Montreal and 1980 games in Moscow had saddled organizers with expenses greatly in excess of revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities except a swim stadium and a velodrome that were paid for by corporate sponsors. The Olympic Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered the most financially successful modern Olympics.\nLater, Afghanistan also decided to boycott the event, becoming the eighth country to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics.  Even later, Hungary (May 16) and Poland (May 17) became the ninth and tenth Marxist countries to join the boycott. Hungary claimed the lives of its athletes would be put in danger if they were to spend time in Los Angeles. On the other hand, Poland said that the United States was engaging in a \u201ccampaign aimed at disturbing the Games\u201d.  \n\nOn May 24, Cuba became the eleventh country to announce its participation in the boycott, making front page news in the United States because it was a \u201cserious blow to boxing and baseball\u201d.  South Yemen was the twelfth country to remove itself from the event (May 27); the Los Angeles Times stated that this was due to their \u201cMarxist\u201d connections.  North Korea was the thirteenth nation to boycott the 1984 Olympics.  Ethiopia became the first African state to participate in the boycott, followed by Angola. \n\nIran had earlier decided to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics because of \u201cUnited States interference in the Middle East, its support for the regime occupying Jerusalem, and the crimes being committed by the U.S.A. in Latin America, especially in El Salvador\u201d.  Iran and Albania were the only countries to not attend both the 1980 Moscow and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Libya also boycotted the Olympics after Libyan journalists were refused entry into the United States in July, along with the 1983 ban upon US exports to Libya and a renewal of bans upon travel to Libya by holders of US passports.  Libya and Ethiopia were the only nations to boycott both the 1976 Montreal and 1984 Los Angeles Games.\n\nRevenge hypothesis",

He has also written essays and prefaces for books by photographers William Eggleston and Manuel Alvarez Bravo, and painters Ed Ruscha and Richard Prince.\n\nWes Craven read an unproduced script of Wagner's (\"They Sleep By Night\"), which led Craven to ask Wagner to co-write \"A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\" (1987). Wagner and Craven wrote the story and share screenwriting credit with Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont. Wagner and Oliver Stone co-executive produced Wild Palms, the mini-series Wagner created, based on a comic strip that he wrote for Details magazine. Wild Palms aired on ABC in 1993.

She plays the character Maisy Woiwode.\n\nProduction\n\nOliver Stone had originally planned to film Bruce Wagner's novel Force Majeure, but then decided to film Wagner's comic strip Wild Palms, published in Details magazine, instead: \"It was so syncretic.  It was such a fractured view of the world. Everything and anything could happen. Maybe your wife isn't your wife, maybe your kids aren't your kids. It really appealed to me.\" Wagner referred to his creation as \"a sort of surreal diary [\u2026] a tone poem\", set in an \"Orwellian Los Angeles\". ABC agreed to finance the project on a budget of $11 Million, but, remembering the eventual decline of David Lynch's Twin Peaks, insisted that the series had \"a complete story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end\".  \n\nActor James Belushi compared the series (among others) to the British TV serial The Prisoner, and stated: \"It's very tough, very challenging\u2014a lot of viewers probably won't dig it.\" Dana Delany suggested that viewers should \"let it wash over you, enjoy each scene, and by the end it'll make sense\". Robert Loggia compared it to Elizabethan play The Duchess of Malfi and the ancient Greek tragedy Medea. ABC, bound to make sure that viewers wouldn't lose attention, had a supplemental book, The Wild Palms Reader, published and offered a telephone hotline with the show's initial run.

    "answer": "A boojum",
    "evidence": "The Hunting of the Snark (An Agony in 8 Fits) is typically categorized as a nonsense poem written by Lewis Carroll, the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. Written from 1874 to 1876, the poem borrows the setting, some creatures, and eight portmanteau words from Carroll's earlier poem \"Jabberwocky\" in his children's novel Through the Looking Glass (1871).\n\nHenry Holiday, the illustrator of the poem, thought of it as a \"tragedy\".\n\nThe plot follows a crew of ten trying to hunt the Snark, an animal which may turn out to be a highly dangerous Boojum. The only one of the crew to find the Snark quickly vanishes, leading the narrator to explain that it was a Boojum after all. The poem is dedicated to young Gertrude Chataway, whom Carroll met at the English seaside town Sandown in the Isle of Wight in 1875. Included with many copies of the first edition of the poem was Carroll's religious tract, An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves \"Alice\".\n\nThe Hunting of the Snark was published by Macmillan in the United Kingdom in late March 1876, with illustrations by Henry Holiday. It had mixed reviews from reviewers who found it strange. The first printing of The Hunting of the Snark consisted of 10,000 copies. There were two reprintings by the conclusion of the year; in total, the poem was reprinted 17 times between 1876 and 1908. Carroll often denied knowing the meaning behind the poem; however, in an 1896 reply to one letter, he agreed with one interpretation of the poem as an allegory for the search for happiness. Scholars have found various meanings in the poem, among them existential angst, an allegory for tuberculosis, and a mockery of the Tichborne case.

After The Age of Innocence, she played the role of Laura Alden opposite Jack Nicholson in Wolf (1994), a horror film that garnered a mixed critical reception.  The New York Times wrote: \"Ms. Pfeiffer's role is underwritten, but her performance is expert enough to make even diffidence compelling\".  The movie grossed US$65\u00a0million (equivalent to $\u00a0million) at the domestic box office and US$131\u00a0million worldwide (equivalent to $\u00a0million).  Her next role was that of high school teacher and former US Marine LouAnne Johnson in the surprise box office hit Dangerous Minds (1995),  which was semi-produced under Pfeiffer's film production company Via Rosa Productions. She appeared as her character in the music video for the soundtrack's lead single, 'Gangsta's Paradise' by Coolio (featuring L.V.), which was used by the producer Jerry Bruckheimer for television advertising. A 60-second version was aired on music channels, while a 30-second cut was aired in the rest of the networks.

His maternal cousin is Lou Pearlman,    founder of 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.\n\nAccording to the Across America DVD, Garfunkel's love for singing originated in the first grade. \"When we were lined up in size order, and after everyone else had left, I'd stay behind and enjoy the echo sound of the stairwell tiles and sing 'Unchained Melody' and 'You'll Never Walk Alone', learning to love this goose-bumps song from the tender age of five.\" Later, Garfunkel's father bought him a wire recorder and from then on, Garfunkel spent his afternoons singing, recording, and playing it back, so he could listen for flaws and learn how to improve.",

    "question": "Who was the last inmate of Spandau jail in Berlin?",
    "answer": "Rudolf Hess",
    "evidence": "Spandau Prison was located in the borough of Spandau in western Berlin. It was constructed in 1876 and demolished in 1987 after the death of its last prisoner, Rudolf Hess, to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine. The site was later rebuilt as a shopping centre for the British forces stationed in Germany.\n\nHistory \n\nSpandau Prison was built in 1876 on Wilhelmstra\u00dfe. It initially served as a military detention center. From 1919 it was also used for civilian inmates. It held up to 600 inmates at that time.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Reichstag fire of 1933, opponents of Hitler and journalists such as Egon Kisch and Carl von Ossietzky were held there in so-called protective custody. Spandau Prison became a sort of predecessor of the Nazi concentration camps. While it was formally operated by the Prussian Ministry of Justice, the Gestapo tortured and abused its inmates, as Egon Erwin Kisch recalls in his memories of Spandau Prison. By the end of 1933 the first Nazi concentration camps had been erected (at Dachau, Osthofen, Oranienburg, Sonnenburg, Lichtenburg and the marshland camps around Esterwegen); all remaining prisoners who had been held in so-called protective custody in state prisons were transferred to these concentration camps.\n\nAfter World War II it was operated by the Four-Power Authorities to house the Nazi war criminals sentenced to imprisonment at the Nuremberg Trials.\n\nOnly seven prisoners were finally imprisoned there. Arriving from Nuremberg on 18 July 1947, they were:\n\nOf the seven, three were released after serving their full sentences, while three others (including Raeder and Funk, who were given life sentences) were released earlier due to ill health. Between 1966 and 1987, Rudolf Hess was the only inmate in  the prison and his only companion was the warden, Eugene K. Bird, who became a close friend. Bird wrote a book about Hess's imprisonment titled The Loneliest Man in the World.",

    "question": "In the 80s who wrote the novel Empire of The Sun?",
    "answer": "J. G. Ballard",
    "evidence": "On 21 March 2015, the band performed at the 2015 Cumbre Taj\u00edn in Veracruz, Mexico.\n\nOn 30 December 2015, Empire of the Sun announced the release of a new album in 2016 on their Facebook page. \n\nIn January 2016, the band's 2008 album title track \"Walking on a Dream\" was featured in a national commercial titled \"The Dreamer\" in the United States for the Japanese automaker Honda to promote the 2016 Honda Civic.  The song finally led to U.S. chart breakthrough for the band, peaking at Number 3 on Billboard's Alternative music charts, topping the dance music charts, and peaking at #40 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.\n\nName \n\nAlthough the name of the project has been attributed to the 1984 novel of the same name by J. G. Ballard,  Littlemore denied this and offers an explanation, saying, \"the name comes more from the idea of (and you'll see this in the ongoing videos) the fact that we're traveling around the world going to all the places of empires of the civilization where the sun has been a theme of worship. It's not based on the Ballard novel nor the Spielberg film of the same name\".\n\nStyle \n\nThe band employs elaborate stage sets and headdress, which reflects the duo's  background in visual art. Littlemore explained that \"we did see Alejandro Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain and it influenced the way we could think about visualization\". However, he emphasised that the inspiration came from various sources. \n\nAwards and accolades\n\nIn the UK, they gained fourth position on the BBC News website's Sound of 2009 poll. \n\nEmpire of the Sun appeared for the first time in a Triple J Hottest 100 with two entries in the 2008 countdown: \"We Are the People\" at number sixty-eight and \"Walking on a Dream\" at number four. \n\n\"Walking on a Dream\" was nominated as \"Song of the Year\" at the 2009 Australian Performing Rights Association awards.\nEmpire of the Sun is a 1984 novel by English writer J. G. Ballard; it was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.  Like Ballard's earlier short story \"The Dead Time\" (published in the anthology Myths of the Near Future), it is essentially fiction but draws extensively on Ballard's experiences in World War II. The name of the novel is derived from the etymology of the name for Japan.\n\nBallard later wrote of his experiences in China as a boy and the making of the film of the same name in his autobiography Miracles of Life.\n\nPlot\n\nThe novel recounts the story of a young British boy, Jamie Graham (named after Ballard's two first names, \"James Graham\"), who lives with his parents in Shanghai. After the Pearl Harbor attack, Japan occupies the Shanghai International Settlement, and in the following chaos Jim becomes separated from his parents.\n\nHe spends some time in abandoned mansions, living on remnants of packaged food. Having exhausted the food supplies, he decides to try to surrender to the Japanese Army. After many attempts, he finally succeeds and is interned in the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center.\n\nAlthough the Japanese are \"officially\" the enemies, Jim identifies partly with them, both because he adores the pilots with their splendid machines and because he feels that Lunghua is still a comparatively safer place for him.\n\nTowards the end of the war, with the Japanese army collapsing, the food supply runs short. Jim barely survives, with people around him starving to death. The camp prisoners are forced upon a march to Nantao, with many dying along the route. Jim then leaves the march and is saved from starvation by air drops from American Bombers. Jim returns to Lunghua camp and finds Dr. Ransome there, soon returning to his pre-war residence with his parents.\n\nFilm adaptation",

Off-court legal distraction from Jamaal Tinsley, Marquis Daniels, and Shawne Williams in the middle of the season did not help the Pacers struggles, and injuries to Tinsley and Jermaine O'Neal damaged the Pacers' already weak defense and left almost all point guard duties to recently acquired Travis Diener, who saw minimal minutes on his previous NBA teams.

Both Granger and Dunleavy were involved in the voting for Most Improved Player, with Dunleavy finishing in the top 10.

DeShannon recorded it in 1974; Carnes's 1981 version spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was Billboards biggest hit of the entire year for 1981. It was also her only Top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart, getting to No. 10. The 1981 recording won the 1982 Grammy Awards for both Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nHistory\n\nThe song was written and composed in 1974 by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon. DeShannon recorded the song that same year on her album New Arrangement.  In this original incarnation, the track is performed in an \"R&B lite\" arrangement, featuring a prominent uptempo piano part, as well as flourishes of pedal steel guitar and horns.  However, it was not until 1981, when Kim Carnes recorded her version of the song in a radically different synthesizer-based arrangement, that \"Bette Davis Eyes\" became a commercial success.\n\nThe Carnes version spent nine non-consecutive weeks on top of the US Billboard Hot 100 (interrupted for one week by the \"Stars on 45 Medley\") and was Billboard's biggest hit of the year for 1981. The single also reached No. 5 on Billboard's Top Tracks charts and No. 26 on the Dance charts. The song won the Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The song was also a number one hit in 21 countries and peaked at number 10 in the United Kingdom, her only Top 40 hit there to date.\n\nAccording to producer Val Garay, the original demo of the tune that was brought to him sounded like \"a Leon Russell track, with this beer-barrel polka piano part.\" The demo can be heard in a Val Garay interview on TAXI TV at 21:50.  Keyboardist Bill Cuomo came up with the signature synth riff, using the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 synthesizer, which now defines Carnes's version.

The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge  and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.   The characteristics of Canadian Aboriginal societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.   Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations. \n\nThe aboriginal population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.  As a consequence of contact with European diseases, Canada's aboriginal peoples suffered from repeated outbreaks of newly introduced infectious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), resulting in a forty to eighty percent population decrease in the centuries after the European arrival.\nThe Lions Gate Bridge, opened in 1938, officially known as the First Narrows Bridge,  is a suspension bridge that crosses the first narrows of Burrard Inlet and connects the City of Vancouver, British Columbia, to the North Shore municipalities of the District of North Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver, and West Vancouver. The term \"Lions Gate\" refers to The Lions, a pair of mountain peaks north of Vancouver. Northbound traffic on the bridge heads in their general direction. A pair of cast concrete lions, designed by sculptor Charles Marega, were placed on either side of the south approach to the bridge in January, 1939.\n\nThe total length of the bridge including the north viaduct is 1,823 metres (5,890 feet). The length including approach spans is 1,517.3\u00a0m (4,978\u00a0ft), the main span alone is 473\u00a0m (1,550\u00a0ft), the tower height is 111\u00a0m (364\u00a0ft), and it has a ship's clearance of 61\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft). Prospect Point in Stanley Park offered a good high south end to the bridge, but the low flat delta land to the north required construction of the extensive North Viaduct.\n\nThe bridge has three reversible lanes, the use of which is indicated by signals. The centre lane changes direction to accommodate for traffic patterns. The traffic volume on the bridge is 60,000 - 70,000 vehicles per day. Trucks exceeding 13 tonnes (14.3 tons) are prohibited, as are vehicles using studded tires.

    "question": "In Greek mythology, who were Arges, Brontes and Steropes?",
    "answer": "Cyclopes",
    "evidence": "Among the earliest literary sources are Homer's two epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Other poets completed the \"epic cycle\", but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely. Despite their traditional name, the \"Homeric Hymns\" have no direct connection with Homer. They are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so-called Lyric age.  Hesiod, a possible contemporary with Homer, offers in his  Theogony  (Origin of the Gods) the fullest account of the earliest Greek myths, dealing with the creation of the world; the origin of the gods, Titans, and Giants; as well as elaborate genealogies, folktales, and etiological myths. Hesiod's Works and Days, a didactic poem about farming life, also includes the myths of Prometheus, Pandora, and the Five Ages. The poet gives advice on the best way to succeed in a dangerous world, rendered yet more dangerous by its gods.\n\nLyrical poets often took their subjects from myth, but their treatment became gradually less narrative and more allusive. Greek lyric poets, including Pindar, Bacchylides and Simonides, and bucolic poets such as Theocritus and Bion, relate individual mythological incidents.  Additionally, myth was central to classical Athenian drama. The tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides took most of their plots from myths of the age of heroes and the Trojan War. Many of the great tragic stories (e.g. Agamemnon and his children, Oedipus, Jason, Medea, etc.) took on their classic form in these tragedies. The comic playwright Aristophanes also used myths, in The Birds and The Frogs.\nArges () was one of the Cyclopes in Greek mythology.  He was elsewhere called Acmonides  or Pyraemon.  His name means \"bright\"Argos (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2) means \"white, quick\" in Greek; see R. S. P. Beekes, Comparative Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction, 2nd edition, revised and corrected by Michiel de Vaan, John Benjamins Publishing Company (2011), p. 181. and represents the brightness from lightning. He is one of Gaia's children by Uranus. In fear, Uranus is said to have locked Arges, along with his brothers, in Tartarus. They were later freed to fashion lightning bolts for Zeus during his attempt to overthrow Cronus.\nA Cyclops ( ; ; plural Cyclopes ; ), in Greek mythology and later Roman mythology, was a member of a primordial race of giants, each with a single eye in the middle of his forehead.  The name literally means \"round-eyed\"  or \"circle-eyed\". \n\nHesiod described three one-eyed Cyclopes, Brontes, Steropes and Arges, the sons of Uranus and Gaia, brothers of the Titans, builders and craftsmen,  while the epic poet Homer described another group of mortal herdsmen Cyclopes the sons of Poseidon. Other accounts were written by the playwright Euripides, poet Theocritus and Roman epic poet Virgil. In Hesiod's Theogony, Zeus releases three Cyclopes from the dark pit of Tartarus. They provide Zeus' thunderbolt, Hades' helmet of invisibility, and Poseidon's trident, and the gods use these weapons to defeat the Titans.\n\nIn a famous episode of Homer's Odyssey, the hero Odysseus encounters the Cyclops Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon and Thoosa, who lives with his fellow Cyclopes in a distant country. The connection between the two groups has been debated in antiquity and by modern scholars.  It is upon Homer's account that Euripides and Virgil based their accounts of the mythical creatures. Strabo describes another group of seven Lycian Cyclopes, also known as \"Bellyhands\" because they earned from their handicraft. They had built the walls of Tiryns and perhaps the caverns and the labyrinths near Nauplia, which are called cyclopean. \n\nMythology and literature \n\nAll the other sources of literature about the cyclopes describe the cyclops Polyphemus, who lived upon an island (often identified by ancient authors with Sicily) populated by the creatures.\n\nVarious ancient Greek and Roman authors wrote about Cyclopes. Hesiod described them as three brothers who were primordial giants.\n\nHomer\n\nWhile Homer does not specifically state that the Cyclopes are one-eyed, this is implied when Odysseus blinds Polyphemus by plunging a stake into his one eye. \n\nHesiod",

Morton's skills as a composer and arranger are apparent in the structure of the pieces, which combines clarity with variety and manages to maintain a balance between ensemble and solo playing while allowing for a substantial solo from every band member.  The quality of the recordings is further enhanced by the band's careful rehearsals, which were uncommon in early jazz performances.  A number of Morton's best piano solos can also be heard on these recordings. \n\nIn 1928, Morton moved to New York, where he continued to make recordings under the name Red Hot Peppers, but collaborated with musicians from his regular band or from other orchestras.

    "evidence": "James Marshall \"Jimi\" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 \u2013 September 18, 1970) was an American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\". \n\nBorn in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin' circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith, who in turn interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"Hey Joe\", \"Purple Haze\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the US; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27.",

    "answer": "Richard Noble",
    "evidence": "Thrust2 is a British designed and built jet propelled car, which held the world land speed record from 4 October 1983 to 25 September 1997.\n\nThe car was designed by John Ackroyd and driven by Richard Noble. The project began with a budget of only \u00a3175.  On 4 October 1983 the car reached a top speed of  and broke the record at  (average speed of two runs within one hour). This was achieved at the Black Rock Desert in Nevada, USA.  It is powered by a single Rolls-Royce Avon jet engine sourced from an English Electric Lightning, and has a configuration somewhat resembling that of the mid-1960s-era J79 turbojet-powered land speed record cars of Art Arfons, collectively known as the \"Green Monster\" cars.\n\nKTVN TV (Reno, Nevada) reporter/photographers Michael Hagerty and Gary Martin covered the record setting attempt in the days leading up to the record.  The car was unceremoniously stored under a tarp in the only automotive garage at Black Rock desert when it wasn't being worked on by the team.  A propane torch was used to burn the line straight down the hard cracked dirt of the desert for the driver to follow.  No other cars were allowed to approach the race track except on the perpendicular lest the driver accidentally follow those car tracks as a different path through the measured mile.\n\nIn 1997 Thrust2's record was broken by Richard Noble's follow up car, ThrustSSC.(Top speed - 1,228 kmph)\n\nWhen the car was offered for sale at \u00a390,000 in 1991, an extensive fundraising campaign was organised without government assistance to keep the car in Britain.  The bid was successful, and today Thrust2 and its successor, ThrustSSC, are displayed at the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry, England.\nThe complete run history is available. \n\nLegacy\n\nIn 1983 Richard Noble had broken the world land speed record with his earlier car Thrust2, which reached a speed of 1,018\u00a0km/h (633\u00a0mph). The date of Andy Green's record came exactly a half century and one day after Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in Earth's atmosphere, with the Bell X-1 research rocket plane on 14 October 1947.\n\nBoth Thrust SSC and Thrust2 are displayed at the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry, England. Thrust SSC is housed in a barrel-roofed hall. Visitors can board the pit trailer from which Thrust SSC runs were controlled, and can ride a motion simulator depicting a computer-generated animation of the record-breaking run from the perspective of Green. \n\nSeveral teams are competing to break the record, including Richard Noble's Bloodhound SSC project  and the North American Eagle project. \n\nRichard Noble\u2013Orange-Intel dispute \n\nIn June 2012, a television advertisement for the Orange San Diego mobile phone, containing an Intel processor, was broadcast on British television and featured a fast car in computer generated imagery. Richard Noble claimed that the car was a representation of Thrust SSC and thus these companies had used his intellectual property without permission, putting the future of the Bloodhound SSC project in doubt. The Advertising Standards Authority rejected the Bloodhound team's complaint, claiming that intellectual property disputes were not in its remit. According to BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, Intel and Orange responded that their production team had researched different styles of \"superfast vehicles\" and developed their own Orange-branded land speed car, and that the advertisement and phone were not connected to Noble or Bloodhound SSC.",

The Plan was largely the creation of State Department officials, especially William L. Clayton and George F. Kennan, with help from the Brookings Institution, as requested by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Marshall spoke of an urgent need to help the European recovery in his address at Harvard University in June 1947. The purpose of the Marshall Plan was to aid in the economic recovery of nations after WWII as well as to antagonize the Soviet Union. In order to combat the effects of the Marshall Plan, the USSR developed its own economic plan, known as the Molotov Plan. \n\nThe phrase \"equivalent of the Marshall Plan\" is often used to describe a proposed large-scale economic rescue program. \n\nDevelopment and deployment\n\nThe reconstruction plan, developed at a meeting of the participating European states, was drafted on June 5, 1947. It offered the same aid to the Soviet Union and its allies, but they refused to accept it,   as doing so would allow a degree of US control over the Communist economies.  In fact, the Soviet Union prevented its satellite states (i.e., East Germany, Poland, etc.) from accepting.

He was the son of martial artist and film actor Bruce Lee and teacher Linda Lee Cadwell, the grandson of Cantonese opera singer Lee Hoi-chuen, and brother of Shannon Lee. \n\nStarting his career with a supporting role in the 1986 television film Kung Fu: The Movie, Lee starred in several low-budget action films during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He died in a firearms accident while filming The Crow in 1993. The film was released posthumously in 1994 with the help of a stunt double and special effects.\n\nEarly life\n\nLee was born on February 1, 1965 in Oakland, California, the son of martial artist and actor Bruce Lee and Linda Emery. The family moved to Los Angeles, California when he was three months old, but they spent some of his early years in Hong Kong as well. Lee was of Chinese, Irish, English, German, and Swedish descent.\n\nHe attended high school at Chadwick School, but was asked to leave for insubordination\u2014more specifically, driving down the school's hill backwards. He briefly attended Bishop Montgomery High School, located in Torrance from 1979 to 1980.  He received his GED in 1983 at the age of 18, and then went to Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts where he majored in theater. After one year, Lee moved to New York City where he took acting lessons at the famed Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute and was part of the American New Theatre group founded by his friend John Lee Hancock. The bulk of Lee's martial arts instruction came from his father's top students, and best friends Dan Inosanto and Richard Bustillo. \n\nCareer\nOn July 20, 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong, to have dinner with James Bond star George Lazenby, with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee's wife Linda, Lee met producer Raymond Chow at 2\u00a0p.m. at home to discuss the making of the film Game of Death. They worked until 4\u00a0p.m. and then drove together to the home of Lee's colleague Betty Ting Pei, a Taiwanese actress. The three went over the script at Ting's home, and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.  \n\nLater Lee complained of a headache, and Ting gave him an analgesic (painkiller), Equagesic, which contained both aspirin and the tranquilizer meprobamate. Around 7:30\u00a0p.m., he went to lie down for a nap. When Lee did not turn up for dinner, producer Raymond Chow came to the apartment, but was unable to wake Lee up. A doctor was summoned, who spent ten minutes attempting to revive Lee before sending him by ambulance to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. By the time the ambulance reached the hospital he was dead. He was 32 years old.\n\nThere was no visible external injury; however, according to autopsy reports, Lee's brain had swollen considerably, from 1,400 to 1,575 grams (a 13% increase). The autopsy found Equagesic in his system. On October 15, 2005, Chow stated in an interview that Lee died from an allergic reaction to the tranquilizer meprobamate, the main ingredient in Equagesic, which Chow described as an ingredient commonly used in painkillers.

Sales were strong (over five million copies)  with the title track being the biggest hit. Another hit came soon after, with \"Addams Groove\" (which appeared on both The Addams Family motion picture soundtrack and the vinyl and cassette versions of 2 Legit 2 Quit), which reached No. 7 in the U.S. and No. 4 in the UK. His video for the song appeared after the movie.\n\nHammer set out on a tour for this album, but the stage show had become as lavish as his lifestyle; loaded with singers, dancers and backup musicians, the supporting concert tour was too expensive for the album's sales to finance, and it was canceled partway through.  In 1992, Boyz II Men joined Hammer's high-profile 2 Legit 2 Quit tour as an opening act. While traveling the country, their tour manager Khalil Roundtree was murdered in Chicago, and the group's future performances of \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\" were dedicated to him.

In 1936 he published  Progress at Pelvis Bay, the first of his many books of social and architectural satire. In 1939 he became cartoonist at the Daily Express, where he pioneered the pocket cartoon, a single-panel, single-column topical drawing appearing on the front page, since imitated in several British newspapers. In these he sympathetically mocked the British upper classes, personified by his characters William (8th Earl of Littlehampton, formerly Viscount Draynflete) and his wife Maudie. During his Express career Lancaster drew some 10,000 cartoons over a period of 40 years.\n\nDuring World War II, Lancaster worked in press censorship, then in Greece as a Foreign Office press attach\u00e9.  During the war years his cartoons provided comic relief from the privations of rationing and bombing raids.\n\nAfter the war Lancaster published Classical Landscape with Figures (1947), The Saracen's Head (1948) and Drayneflete Revealed (1949), the last dealing with the Littlehamptons' architectural and artistic inheritances. Along with The Littlehampton Bequest (1973, foreword by Sir Roy Strong), it provided a humorous and satirical but very well-informed, survey of architectural and aesthetic trends in British and European history.",

    "evidence": "\"Girl power\"\n\nThe phrase \"girl power\" put a name to a social phenomenon, but the slogan was met with mixed reactions. The phrase was a label for the particular facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. This concept was by no means original in the pop world: both Madonna and Bananarama had employed similar outlooks. The phrase, whilst coined by Welsh indie band Helen Love in 1993  and used as the title of an album by British pop duo Shampoo in 1995, had been used in 1987 by a London a capella all-girl group called Mint Juleps. With the production might of Trevor Horn behind them, this group had released a track called \"Girl to the Power of 6\". The format of the song, whilst having an obvious 1980s sound, had a similar format to the Spice Girls' \"Wannabe\", where each girl presented a distinct personality trait. The phrases \"Girl to the Power\" and \"Girl Power\" are mentioned several times, as well as strong overtones of female empowerment, unity and loyalty. However, the formula did not work for the Mint Juleps, perhaps being too far ahead of its time. It was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 with \"Wannabe\", over 9 years later, that the concept of \"Girl power\" exploded onto the common consciousness. The Spice Girls' version was distinctive. Its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women, and it emphasised the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females.",

His diverse body of work, spanning six decades, covers numerous genres and subjects throughout the Americas, Europe, and Africa.\n\nEarly modernist work\n\nStrand was born in New York City to Bohemian parents. In his late teens, he was a student of renowned documentary photographer Lewis Hine at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School. It was while on a fieldtrip in this class that Strand first visited the 291 art gallery \u2013 operated by Stieglitz and Edward Steichen \u2013 where exhibitions of work by forward-thinking modernist photographers and painters would move Strand to take his photographic hobby more seriously. Stieglitz would later promote Strand's work in the 291 gallery itself, in his photography publication Camera Work, and in his artwork in the Hieninglatzing studio. Some of this early work, like the well-known \"Wall Street,\" experimented with formal abstractions (influencing, among others, Edward Hopper and his idiosyncratic urban vision).

McEnroe and Borg were battling for the top spot in those years, while Connors played the role of the spoiler. However, in 1982, at age 29, Connors was back in the Wimbledon singles final, where he faced McEnroe, who by then was established firmly as the world's top player. Connors recovered from being three points away from defeat in a fourth-set tie-break (at 3\u20134) to win the match, 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20137, 7\u20136, 6\u20134, and claim his second Wimbledon title, eight years after his first. Although Connors' tour record against McEnroe is 14\u201320, McEnroe is six years younger than Connors and had a losing record against Connors until he won 12 out of their last 14 meetings. Head to head in major championship finals, they split their two meetings, Connors winning the 1982 Wimbledon and McEnroe winning the 1984 Wimbledon.\n\nIvan Lendl\n\nConnors defeated another of the next generation of tennis stars, Ivan Lendl, in the 1982 US Open final and soon regained the world No. 1 ranking. Connors has a tour record of 13\u201322 against Lendl, but Lendl is seven years younger than Connors and had a losing record against Connors until he won their last seventeen matches from 1984 through 1992, after Connors' prime. Head to head in major championship finals, Connors took both meetings, winning the 1982 and 1983 US Open.\n\nOther matches\n\nConnors continued to compete against younger men well into his 41st year.\n\nIn the fourth round of the 1987 Wimbledon Championships, Connors defeated Mikael Pernfors, ten years his junior, 1\u20136, 1\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20134, 6\u20132, after having trailed 4\u20131 in the third set and 3\u20130 in the fourth set. In July 1988, Connors ended a four-year title drought by winning the Sovran Bank Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C. It was the 106th title of his career.

He was born in rural Narrows, Georgia. Cobb spent 22 seasons with the Detroit Tigers, the last six as the team's player-manager, and finished his career with the Philadelphia Athletics. In 1936 Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes (98.2%); no other player received a higher percentage of votes until 1992.  In 1999, editors at the Sporting News ranked Ty Cobb 3rd on their list of \"Baseball's 100 Greatest Players\". \n\nCobb is widely credited with setting 90 MLB records during his career. He still holds several records as of the end of the 2014 season, including the highest career batting average  (.366 or .367, depending on source) and most career batting titles with 11 (or 12, depending on source).  He retained many other records for almost a half century or more, including most career hits until 1985 (4,189 or 4,191, depending on source), most career runs (2,245 or 2,246 depending on source) until 2001, most career games played (3,035) and at bats (11,429 or 11,434 depending on source) until 1974, and the modern record for most career stolen bases (892) until 1977. He still holds the career record for stealing home (54 times) and for stealing second base, third base, and home in succession (5 times), and as the youngest player ever to compile 4,000 hits and score 2,000 runs. Cobb ranks fifth all-time in number of games played and committed 271 errors, the most by any American League (AL) outfielder.",

    "question": "Who set fire to his guitar at the Monterey Pop festival in 19676?",
    "answer": "Jimi Hendrix",
    "evidence": "\"Fire\" is a song written by Jimi Hendrix and recorded by the Jimi Hendrix Experience in early 1967.  It has been described as \"an exercise in soul, psychedelic rock, and polyrhythmic jazz-inspired drumming\" by AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald. The song was remixed in stereo for the American release of the album.  In 1969, it was released as a stereo single in the UK with the title \"Let Me Light Your Fire\".  One of Hendrix's most popular songs, he frequently played it in concert.  Several live recordings have been released and the original song is included on numerous Hendrix compilations, such as Smash Hits, Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix, Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection, and Fire: The Jimi Hendrix Collection.\n\nOverview\n\nDespite its sexual overtones, the song had an innocuous origin. Noel Redding, bass player for the Experience, invited Hendrix to his mother's house on a cold New Year's Eve in Folkestone, England, after a gig.  Hendrix asked Noel's mother if he could stand next to her fireplace to warm himself. She agreed, but her Great Dane was in the way, so Hendrix let out with, \"Aw, move over, Rover, and let Jimi take over\". Hendrix later joked with the lyric: \"Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard to find her poor dog a bone, but when she bent over Rover took over, 'cause Rover had a bone of his own! Shakespeare, page 35!\"\nSlides\n\nA slide, (neck of a bottle, knife blade or round metal bar) is used in blues and rock to create a glissando or \"Hawaiian\" effect. The necks of bottles were often used in blues and country music. Modern slides are constructed of glass, plastic, ceramic, chrome, brass or steel, depending on the weight and tone desired. An instrument that is played exclusively in this manner (using a metal bar) is called a steel guitar or pedal steel. Slide playing to this day is very popular in blues music and country music. Some slide players use a so-called Dobro guitar.\n\nSome performers who have become famous for playing slide are Robert Johnson, Elmore James, Ry Cooder, George Harrison, Bonnie Raitt, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, Duane Allman, Muddy Waters, Rory Gallagher, and George Thorogood.\n\nPlectrum\n\nA \"guitar pick\" or \"plectrum\" is a small piece of hard material generally held between the thumb and first finger of the picking hand and is used to \"pick\" the strings. Though most classical players pick with a combination of fingernails and fleshy fingertips, the pick is most often used for electric and steel-string acoustic guitars. Though today they are mainly plastic, variations do exist, such as bone, wood, steel or tortoise shell. Tortoise shell was the most commonly used material in the early days of pick-making, but as tortoises and turtles became endangered, the practice of using their shells for picks or anything else was banned. Tortoise-shell picks made before the ban are often coveted for a supposedly superior tone and ease of use, and their scarcity has made them valuable.\nPerformances\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nWith two huge singles behind them, Jefferson Airplane was one of the major attractions of the festival.\n\nThe Who\n\nAlthough already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier, The Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. The band used rented Vox amps for their set, which were not as powerful as their regular Sound City amps which they had left in England to save shipping costs. At the end of their frenetic performance of \"My Generation\", the audience was stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend smashed his guitar, smoke bombs exploded behind the amps and frightened concert staff rushed onstage to retrieve expensive microphones. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. The Who, after winning a coin toss, performed before Jimi Hendrix, as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other, both having planned instrument-demolishing conclusions to their respective sets.\n\nThe Grateful Dead\n\n\"The Grateful Dead were beautiful. They did at top volume what Shankar had done softly. They played pure music, some of the best music of the concert. I have never heard anything in music that could be said to be qualitatively better than the performance of The Dead, Sunday night.\" - Michael Lydon, author of Flashbacks (2003)\n\n\"[The Who] smashing all their equipment. I mean, they did it so well. It looked so great. It was like, 'Wow, that is beautiful.' We went on. We played our little music. And it seemed so lame to me, at the time. And [Jimi Hendrix] was also beautiful and incredible and sounded great and looked great. I loved both acts. I sat there gape-jawed. They were wonderful.\" - Jerry Garcia\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience",

    "evidence": "Della Street is the fictional secretary of Perry Mason in the long-running series of novels, short stories, films, and radio and television programs featuring the fictional defense attorney created by Erle Stanley Gardner.\n\nDescription\n\nIn the first Perry Mason novel, The Case of the Velvet Claws, written in the early days of the Great Depression, it is revealed that Della Street came from a wealthy, or at least well-to-do, family that was wiped out by the stock market crash of 1929. Della was forced to get a job as a secretary. By the time of the TV series in the 1950s and 1960s, this would have not fit well with the age of the characters as then portrayed. According to The Case of The Caretaker's Cat, she is approximately 15 years younger than Perry Mason.\n\nA character named Della Street first appeared in Gardner's unpublished novel Reasonable Doubt, where she was a secretary, but not the secretary of the lawyer, Ed Stark. Gardner described her this way: \"Della Street \u2026 Secretary, twenty-seven, quiet, fast as hell on her feet, had been places. Worked in a carnival or side show, knows all the lines, hard-boiled exterior, quietly efficient, puzzled over the lawyer, chestnut hair, trim figure, some lines on her face, a hint of weariness at the corners of her eyes.\"  When Gardner submitted Reasonable Doubt to William Morrow, an editor suggested that \"Della Street is a better character than the secretary.\" Gardner took this suggestion when he rewrote Reasonable Doubt as The Case of the Velvet Claws and made Della Street Perry Mason's secretary. In the published novel, the carnival or side show was jettisoned, and Street came from a more respectable background. This is a good example of the difference between the pulp writing and slick writing of the 1930s. \n\nIn 1950 Gardner published the short story \"The Case of the Suspect Sweethearts\" under the pseudonym Della Street.",

Winfrey has gone on public record stating that she ate 30 pounds of macaroni and cheese when she was informed the Saturday after the movie opened that \"we got beat by something called Chucky.\"   Oprah also claimed that Beloveds failure at the box office was the worst moment in her career and brought her into a major depression. \"It was the only time in my life that I was ever depressed, and I recognised that I (was) depressed because I've done enough shows (on the topic).

    "answer": "Tinkerbell",
    "evidence": "1990s\n\nRoberts became known to worldwide audiences when she starred with Richard Gere in the Cinderella/Pygmalionesque story, Pretty Woman, in 1990. Roberts won the role after Michelle Pfeiffer, Molly Ringwald, Meg Ryan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Karen Allen, and Daryl Hannah (her co-star in Steel Magnolias) turned it down.  The role also earned her a second Oscar nomination, this time as Best Actress, and second Golden Globe Award win, as Motion Picture Best Actress (Musical or Comedy). Her next box office success was the thriller Sleeping with the Enemy, playing a battered wife who escapes her abusive husband, played by Patrick Bergin, and begins a new life in Iowa. She played Tinkerbell in Steven Spielberg's Hook in 1991, and also played a nurse in the 1991 film, Dying Young. This work was followed by a two-year hiatus, during which she made no films other than a cameo appearance in Robert Altman's The Player (1992). In early 1993, she was the subject of a People magazine cover story asking, \"What Happened to Julia Roberts?\"  She was offered the role of Annie Reed in Sleepless in Seattle (1993), but turned it down.\n\nRoberts co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Pelican Brief (1993), based on John Grisham's 1992 novel of the same name. In 1996, she appeared in season 2 of Friends (episode 13 \"The One After the Superbowl\").  She had a relationship with cast member Matthew Perry at the time.     According to an audience member, Roberts said to Perry about their on-screen kiss, \"I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend.\"  She was offered the role of Lucy Eleanor Moderatz in While You Were Sleeping (1995), but turned it down.\nHook is a 1991 American fantasy adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg  and written by James V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo. It stars Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, Robin Williams as Peter Pan/Peter Banning, Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell, Bob Hoskins as Smee, Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy, Caroline Goodall as Moira Banning, and Charlie Korsmo as Jack Banning. The film acts as a sequel to J. M. Barrie's  1911 novel Peter and Wendy  focusing on an adult Peter Pan who has forgotten all about his childhood. In his new life, Peter Pan is known as Peter Banning, a successful but unimaginative corporate lawyer with a wife (Wendy's granddaughter) and two children. However, when the old enemy of his past, Hook, kidnaps his children, Peter once again returns to Neverland in order to save them. Along the journey Peter reclaims his youthful spirit that unlocks the memory to his past.\n\nSpielberg began developing the film in the early 1980s with Walt Disney Productions and Paramount Pictures, which would have followed the story line seen in the 1924 silent film and 1953 animated film. Peter Pan entered pre-production in 1985, but Spielberg abandoned the project. James V. Hart developed the script with director, Nick Castle and TriStar Pictures before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989. Hook was shot almost entirely on sound stages at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and while it was a commercial success, its box office intake was lower than expected. Hook was nominated in five categories at the 64th Academy Awards. It also spawned merchandise, including video games, action figures, and comic book adaptations.\n\nPlot",

    "question": "Which US president did Anthony Hopkins play in a film whose title was simply his name?",
    "answer": "Nixon",
    "evidence": "Since the amendment's adoption, four presidents have served two full terms: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. Barack Obama has been elected to a second term, and will complete his term on 20 January 2017, if he does not die or resign before that date. Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush sought a second term, but were defeated. Richard Nixon was elected to a second term, but resigned before completing it. Lyndon B. Johnson was the only president under the amendment to be eligible to serve more than two terms in total, having served for only fourteen months following John F. Kennedy's assassination. However, Johnson withdrew from the 1968 Democratic Primary, surprising many Americans. Gerald Ford sought a full term, after serving out the last two years and five months of Nixon's second term, but was not elected.\n\nVacancy or disability\n\nVacancies in the office of President may arise under several possible circumstances: death, resignation and removal from office.\n\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows the House of Representatives to impeach high federal officials, including the president, for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 gives the Senate the power to remove impeached officials from office, given a two-thirds vote to convict. The House has thus far impeached two presidents: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was subsequently convicted by the Senate; however, Johnson was acquitted by just one vote.\nSir Philip Anthony Hopkins, CBE (born 31 December 1937), is a Welsh  actor of film, stage, and television. After graduating from the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in 1957, he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and was then spotted by Laurence Olivier who invited him to join the Royal National Theatre. In 1968, he got his break in film in The Lion in Winter, playing King Richard the Lionheart.\n\nConsidered to be one of the greatest living actors,    Hopkins is well known for his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, its sequel Hannibal, and the prequel Red Dragon. Other notable films include The Mask of Zorro, The Bounty, Meet Joe Black, The Elephant Man, Magic, 84 Charing Cross Road, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Legends of the Fall, Thor, The Remains of the Day, Amistad, Nixon, The World's Fastest Indian, Instinct, and Fracture.\n\nAlong with his Academy Award, Hopkins has won three BAFTA Awards, two Emmys, and the Cecil B. DeMille Award. In 1993, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to the arts. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003, and was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2008.\n\nEarly life\n\nHopkins was born on New Year's Eve 1937, in Margam, a suburb of Port Talbot, Glamorgan.   His parents are Annie Muriel (n\u00e9e Yeates) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker.  His school days were unproductive; he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School in Pontypool. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at Cowbridge Grammar School in the Vale of Glamorgan.\nJohnson was rewarded with an electoral landslide in 1964 against conservative Barry Goldwater, which broke the decades-long control of Congress by the Conservative coalition. However, the Republicans bounced back in 1966 and elected Richard Nixon in 1968. Nixon largely continued the New Deal and Great Society programs he inherited; conservative reaction would come with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Meanwhile, the American people completed a great migration from farms into the cities and experienced a period of sustained economic expansion.\n\nCivil Rights Movement\n\nStarting in the late 1950s, institutionalized racism across the United States, but especially in the South, was increasingly challenged by the growing Civil Rights movement. The activism of African-American leaders Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr. led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which launched the movement. For years African Americans would struggle with violence against them  but would achieve great steps toward equality with Supreme Court decisions, including Brown v. Board of Education and Loving v. Virginia, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which ended the Jim Crow laws that legalized racial segregation between whites and blacks.",

When Tally was about halfway through with the first draft, Hackman withdrew from the project and financing fell through. However, Orion Pictures co-founder Mike Medavoy assured Tally to keep writing as the studio itself took care of financing and searched for a replacement director.  As a result, Orion Pictures sought director Jonathan Demme to helm the project. With the screenplay not yet completed, Demme signed on after reading the novel.  From there, the project quickly took off, as Tally explained, \"[Demme] read my first draft not long after it was finished, and we met, then I was just startled by the speed of things.

    "question": "Which much-loved actor won the Best Actor Oscar for The Philadelphia Story?",
    "answer": "James Stewart",
    "evidence": "The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 American romantic comedy film   directed by George Cukor, starring Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and James Stewart and featuring Ruth Hussey. Based on the Broadway play of the same name by Philip Barry, the film is about a socialite whose wedding plans are complicated by the simultaneous arrival of her ex-husband and a tabloid magazine journalist. The socialite character of the play\u2014performed by Hepburn in the film\u2014was inspired by Helen Hope Montgomery Scott (1904\u20131995), a Philadelphia socialite known for her hijinks, who married a friend of playwright Barry. \n\nWritten for the screen by Donald Ogden Stewart and an uncredited Waldo Salt, it is considered one of the best examples of a comedy of remarriage, a genre popular in the 1930s and 1940s, in which a couple divorce, flirt with outsiders and then remarry \u2013 a useful story-telling ploy at a time when the depiction of extramarital affairs was blocked by the Production Code.\n\nThe film was Hepburn's first big hit following several flops, which had led to her being included on a 1938 list that Manhattan movie theater owner Harry Brandt compiled of actors considered to be \"box office poison.\"   She acquired the film rights to the play, which she had also starred in, with the help of Howard Hughes,  in order to control it as a vehicle for her screen comeback.  According to a Turner Broadcasting documentary MGM: When the Lion Roars, after MGM purchased the film rights they were skeptical about Hepburn's box office appeal, so Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Louis B. Mayer took an unusual precaution by casting two A-list male stars (Grant and Stewart) to support Miss Hepburn.\n\nNominated for six Academy Awards, the film won two; James Stewart for Best Actor and Donald Ogden Stewart for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was remade in 1956 as a musical, retitled High Society.",

    "evidence": "Source music in portions of the film includes instrumental versions of \"Again\" by Lionel Newman and Dorcas Cochran, \"You Make Me Feel So Young\" by Josef Myrow and Mack Gordon, and \"The More I See You\" by Harry Warren and Mack Gordon. \n\nA snippet of a cue from Williams\u2019 score to Cinderella Liberty titled 'Maggie Shoots Pool' is heard in a scene when William Holden's character converses on the phone with Paul Newman's character. It is not the recording on the soundtrack album but a newer arrangement recorded for The Towering Inferno. An extended version is heard, ostensibly as source music in a deleted theatrical scene sometimes shown as part of a longer scene from the TV broadcast version.\n\nOne of the most sought-after unreleased music cues from the film is the one where Williams provides low-key lounge music during a party prior to the announcement of a fire. O\u2019Halloran orders Duncan to evacuate the party; the music becomes louder as Lisolette and Harlee are seen dancing and Duncan lectures son-in-law Roger.  Titled \"The Promenade Room\" on the conductor's cue sheet, the track features a ragged ending as Duncan asks the house band to stop playing. Because of this, Film Score Monthly could not add this cue to the expanded soundtrack album.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning song \"We May Never Love Like This Again\" was composed by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn and performed by Maureen McGovern, who appears in a cameo as a lounge singer and on the score's soundtrack album, which features the film recording plus the commercially released single version.  Additionally, the theme tune is interpolated into the film's underscore by Williams. The song's writers collaborated on \"The Morning After\" from The Poseidon Adventure which was also sung by McGovern, although hers was not the vocal in that film.\n\nThe first release of portions of the score from The Towering Inferno was on Warner Bros. Records early in 1975 (Catalog No. BS-2840)",

    "question": "Who was the male star of the movie The Man of La Mancha?",
    "answer": "Peter O'Toole",
    "evidence": "Man of La Mancha was first performed at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut in 1965, and had its New York  premiere on the thrust stage of the ANTA Washington Square Theatre in 1965. \n\nHistory\n\nMan of La Mancha started as a non-musical teleplay written by Dale Wasserman for CBS's DuPont Show of the Month program. This original telecast starred Lee J. Cobb, Colleen Dewhurst (who replaced Viveca Lindfors), and Eli Wallach, and was not performed on a thrust stage, but on a television sound stage.  The DuPont Corporation disliked the title Man of La Mancha, thinking that its viewing audience would not know what La Mancha actually meant, so a new title, I, Don Quixote, was chosen. The play was broadcast live on November 9, 1959, with an estimated audience of 20 million.  Unfortunately, due to the production being staged in the early days of videotape, and due to the inferiority of kinescopes, no footage of this production survives.\n\nYears after this television broadcast, and after the original teleplay had been unsuccessfully optioned as a non-musical Broadway play, director Albert Marre called Wasserman and suggested that he turn his play into a musical. Mitch Leigh was selected as composer, with orchestrations by Carlyle W. Hall. Unusually for the time, the show was scored for an orchestra with no violins or other traditional orchestral stringed instruments apart from a double bass, instead making heavier use of brass, woodwinds, percussion and utilizing flamenco guitars as the only stringed instruments of any sort. \n\nThe original lyricist of the musical was poet W. H. Auden, but his lyrics were discarded, some of them considered too overtly satiric and biting, attacking the bourgeois audience at times. Auden's lyrics were replaced by those of Joe Darion. \n\nProductions\nMan of La Mancha is a 1972 film adaptation of the Broadway musical Man of La Mancha by Dale Wasserman, with music by Mitch Leigh and lyrics by Joe Darion. The musical was suggested by the classic novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, but more directly based on Wasserman's 1959 non-musical television play, I, Don Quixote, which combines a semi-fictional episode from the life of Cervantes with scenes from his novel.\n\nThe film was financed by an Italian production company, Produzioni Europee Associates, and shot in Rome. However, it is entirely in English, and all of its principal actors except for Sophia Loren are either British or American. (Gino Conforti, who plays the Barber, is an American of Italian descent.) The film was released by United Artists. It is known in Italy as L'Uomo della Mancha.\n\nThe film was produced and directed by Arthur Hiller, and stars Peter O'Toole as both Miguel de Cervantes and Don Quixote, James Coco as both Cervantes' Manservant and Don Quixote's \"squire\" Sancho Panza, and Sophia Loren as scullery maid and prostitute Aldonza, whom the delusional Don Quixote idolizes as Dulcinea. Gillian Lynne, who later choreographed Cats, staged the choreography for the film (including the fight scenes).\n\nGino Conforti, as the barber, is the only member of the original Broadway musical cast to repeat his role for the film.\n\nPlot\n\nCervantes and his manservant have been imprisoned by the Spanish Inquisition, and  a manuscript by Cervantes is seized by his fellow inmates, who subject him to a mock trial in order to determine whether the manuscript should be returned. Cervantes' defense is in the form of a play, in which Cervantes takes the role of Alonso Quijana, an old gentleman who has lost his mind and now believes that he should go forth as a knight-errant. Quijano renames himself Don Quixote de La Mancha, and sets out to find adventures with his \"squire\", Sancho Panza.\n\nCast",

She has also appeared in films such as 101 Dalmatians (1996), Event Horizon (1997), The Patriot (2000), Anonymous (2011), and the Hollywood film adaptation The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011).\n\nEarly life\n\nRichardson was born in Marylebone, London to the theatrical Redgrave family, the daughter of actress Vanessa Redgrave and director Tony Richardson, and the granddaughter of actors Sir Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, Lady Redgrave. She is the sister of the late actress Natasha Richardson (1963\u20132009), and through her, she is the sister-in-law of actor Liam Neeson, and the aunt of Miche\u00e1l and Daniel Neeson. She was the niece of the late Lynn Redgrave and the late Corin Redgrave and cousin of actress Jemma Redgrave, who is just five days younger than Richardson. Joely Richardson appeared as an extra at the age of three in the 1968 version of The Charge of the Light Brigade, directed by her father.\n\nRichardson and her sister Natasha's early education began in London at the independent St Paul's Girls' School in Hammersmith.  At age 14 Richardson moved to boarding school at the independent Harry Hopman Tennis School in Tampa, Florida. In 1983, she graduated from the Thacher School in Ojai, California, then returned to London to study at Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. \n\nCareer\nIn 2004, Vanessa Redgrave and her brother Corin Redgrave launched the Peace and Progress Party, which campaigned against the Iraq War and for human rights. However, in June 2005 Redgrave left the party.\n\nRedgrave has been an outspoken critic of the \"war on terrorism\".   During a June 2005 interview on Larry King Live, Redgrave was challenged on this criticism and on her political views. In response she questioned whether there can be true democracy if the political leadership of the United States and Britain does not \"uphold the values for which my father's generation fought the Nazis, [and] millions of people gave their lives against the Soviet Union's regime. [Such sacrifice was made] because of democracy and what democracy meant: no torture, no camps, no detention forever or without trial.... [Such] techniques are not just alleged [against the governments of the U.S. and Britain], they have actually been written about by the FBI. I don't think it's being 'far left'...to uphold the rule of law.\" \n\nIn March 2006, Redgrave remarked in an interview with US broadcast journalist Amy Goodman: \"I don't know of a single government that actually abides by international human rights law, not one, including my own. In fact, [they] violate these laws in the most despicable and obscene way, I would say.\"\n\nGoodman\u2019s interview with Redgrave took place in the actress\u2019s West London home on the evening of 7 March, and covered a range of subjects, particularly the cancellation by the New York Theater Workshop of the Alan Rickman production My Name is Rachel Corrie. Such a development, said Redgrave, was an \"act of catastrophic cowardice\" as \"the essence of life and the essence of theatre is to communicate about lives, either lives that have ended or lives that are still alive, [and about] beliefs, and what is in those beliefs.\"",

The dam eliminated the natural flooding, which threatened many species adapted to the flooding, including both plants and animals. The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam. Four species of fish native to the Colorado River, the Bonytail chub, Colorado pikeminnow, Humpback chub, and Razorback sucker, are listed as endangered.\n\nNaming controversy \n\nDuring the years of lobbying leading up to the passage of legislation authorizing the dam in 1928, the press generally referred to the dam as \"Boulder Dam\" or as \"Boulder Canyon Dam\", even though the proposed site had shifted to Black Canyon.  The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 (BCPA) never mentioned a proposed name or title for the dam. The BCPA merely allows the government to \"construct, operate, and maintain a dam and incidental works in the main stream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon\".\n\nWhen Secretary Wilbur spoke at the ceremony starting the building of the railway between Las Vegas and the dam site on September 17, 1930, he named the dam \"Hoover Dam\", citing a tradition of naming dams after Presidents, though none had been so honored during their terms of office.  Wilbur justified his choice on the ground that Hoover was \"the great engineer whose vision and persistence\u00a0... has done so much to make [the dam] possible\".

Herman owed the IRS millions of dollars and was in danger of eviction from his home. With this added stress, Herman still kept performing. In a December 5, 1985, review of the band at the Blue Note jazz club for The New York Times, John S. Wilson pointed out: \"In a one-hour set, Mr. Herman is able to show off his latest batch of young stars\u2014the baritone saxophonist Mike Brignola, the bassist Bill Moring, the pianist Brad Williams, the trumpeter Ron Stout\u2014and to remind listeners that one of his own basic charms is the dry humor with which he shouts the blues.\" Wilson also spoke about arrangements by Bill Holman and John Fedchock for special attention.  Wilson spoke of the continuing influence of Duke Ellington on Woody Herman bands from the nineteen forties to the nineteen eighties.  In 1986, from December 21\u201323, about ten months prior to his death, Herman was a guest at a friend's house in Iowa City, Iowa.

The music was performed by members of The Wrecking Crew. The session drummer was Hal Blaine,  Carol Kaye played bass and Leon Russell both played keyboards and arranged the music. The song was produced by Snuff Garrett.\n\nStylistically, the song's recording features the then common \"basic 'combo' instrumentation...(electric guitar, organ, bass, drums), modal (dorian) inflections in the harmony and melody of the verse and a basic rock beat pattern.\" Unusually the chorus features timpani and the transition between verse and chorus creates a daring modulation from C minor (dorian) to G-flat major. \n\n\"The musical style,\" writes Brackett, \"skims aspects from contemporary rock songs, and is then produced and arranged from the vantage point of 'easy-listening' music.\" The song's harmonic progression resembles those of Beatles songs such as the G-flat/F/E-flat/D-flat descending bass line (\"Bad to Me\") and the vi-iii movement (\"Please Please Me,\" \"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\" \"She Loves You,\" \"And I Love Her,\" and others). The melodic turn on \"true\" of \"if you find someone whose heart is true\" resembles those in \"Please Please Me\" (\"Last night I said these words to my girl\") and \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" (\"nobody knows, just we two\").",

    "answer": "Sweden",
    "evidence": "Residual radioactivity in the environment\n\nRivers, lakes and reservoirs\n\nThe Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the Pripyat River, which feeds into the Dnieper reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in Europe, which at the time supplied water to Kiev's 2.4 million residents, and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred.  The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident.Chernobyl: Catastrophe and Consequences, Springer, Berlin ISBN 3-540-23866-2 In the most affected areas of Ukraine, levels of radioactivity (particularly from radionuclides 131I, 137Cs and 90Sr) in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident, though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom \"in an insoluble phase\" and would not dissolve for 800\u20131000 years. Guidelines for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to 3,700\u00a0Bq/L, allowing most water to be reported as safe, and a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the Chernobyl plant's cooling pond was within acceptable norms. Despite this, two months after the disaster the Kiev water supply was abruptly switched from the Dnieper to the Desna River. Meanwhile, massive silt traps were constructed, along with an enormous 30m-deep underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the Pripyat River.",

    "question": "In which country was the first permanent bungee jumping site situated?",
    "answer": "New Zealand",
    "evidence": "Not to be confused with reverse bungee.\n\nBungee jumping (; also spelt \"bungy\" jumping, which is the usual spelling in New Zealand and several other countries)  \nis an activity that involves jumping from a tall structure while connected to a large elastic cord. The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to hover above the ground. The thrill comes from the free-falling and the rebound.  When the person jumps, the cord stretches and the jumper flies upwards again as the cord recoils, and continues to oscillate up and down until all the kinetic energy is dissipated.\n\nHistory \n\nThe first modern bungee jumps were made on 1 April 1979 from the 250 ft Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, by David Kirke and Simon Keeling,  both members of the Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club.  The jumpers were arrested shortly after, but continued with jumps in the US from the Golden Gate Bridge and the Royal Gorge Bridge (this last jump sponsored by and televised on the American programme That's Incredible), spreading the concept worldwide. By 1982, they were jumping from mobile cranes and hot air balloons.\n\nOrganised commercial bungee jumping began with the New Zealander, A J Hackett, who made his first jump from Auckland's Greenhithe Bridge in 1986.  During the following years, Hackett performed a number of jumps from bridges and other structures (including the Eiffel Tower), building public interest in the sport, and opening the world's first permanent commercial bungee site, the Kawarau Bridge Bungy at the Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge near Queenstown in the South Island of New Zealand.  Hackett remains one of the largest commercial operators, with concerns in several countries.",

    "question": "Who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet premier?",
    "answer": "Andropov",
    "evidence": "Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev (;  ; , 19 December 1906 (O.S. 6 December)\u00a0\u2013 10 November 1982) was the General Secretary of the Central Committee (CC) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), presiding over the country from 1964 until his death in 1982. His eighteen-year term as General Secretary was second only to that of Joseph Stalin in duration. During Brezhnev's rule, the global influence of the Soviet Union grew dramatically, in part because of the expansion of the Soviet military during this time. His tenure as leader was marked by the beginning of an era of economic and social stagnation in the Soviet Union.\n\nBrezhnev was born in Kamianske into a Russian worker's family. After graduating from the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum, he became a metallurgical engineer in the iron and steel industry, in Ukraine. He joined Komsomol in 1923, and in 1929 became an active member of the CPSU. He was drafted into immediate military service during World War II and left the army in 1946 with the rank of major general. In 1952 Brezhnev became a member of the Central Committee, and during 1964, Brezhnev succeeded Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary, while Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his post as Soviet premier.\nKhrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive. In 1962, he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. An agreement was made between the Soviet Union and the United States to remove enemy nuclear missiles from both Cuba and Turkey, concluding the crisis. This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964.\n\nBrezhnev era\n\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.\n\nIn 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms. In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of Eastern European states by introducing the Brezhnev Doctrine, which claimed the right of the Soviet Union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace Marxism\u2013Leninism with capitalism.\n\nBrezhnev presided over a period of d\u00e9tente with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control (SALT I, SALT II, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty) while at the same time building up Soviet military might.\n\nIn October 1977, the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted. The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change. The long period of Brezhnev's rule had come to be dubbed one of \"standstill\", with an aging and ossified top political leadership.\n\nGorbachev era\nKhrushchev denounced Stalin on two occasions: in 1956 and 1962. His policy of de-Stalinisation earned him many enemies within the party, especially from old Stalinist appointees. Many saw this approach as destructive and destabilising. A group known as Anti-Party Group tried, but failed, to oust Khrushchev from office in 1957. As Khrushchev grew older, his erratic behavior became worse, usually making decisions without discussing or confirming them with the Politburo. Leonid Brezhnev, a close companion of Khrushchev, was elected First Secretary the same day of Khrushchev's removal from power; Alexei Kosygin became the new Premier and Anastas Mikoyan kept his office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. In 1965, on the orders of the Politburo, Mikoyan was forced to retire; Nikolai Podgorny took over the office of Chairman of the Presidium. The USSR in the post-Khrushchev 1960s was governed by a collective leadership. Henry A. Kissinger, the American National Security Advisor, mistakenly believed that Kosygin was the 'Leader of the Soviet Union and that he was at the helm of 'Soviet foreign policy' because he represented the Soviet Union at the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference. The \"Era of Stagnation\", a derogatory term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, was a period marked by low socio-economic efficiency in the country and a gerontocracy ruling the country. Yuri Andropov succeeded Brezhnev in his post as General Secretary in 1982. In 1983 Andropov was hospitalised, and rarely met up at work to chair the politburo meetings due to his declining health. Nikolai Tikhonov usually chaired the meetings in his place. Following Andropov's death, an even older leader, Konstantin Chernenko was elected to the General Secretariat. His rule lasted for little more than a year.",

    "question": "Who's home runs record did Mark McGwire break in the 1998 season?",
    "answer": "Roger Maris",
    "evidence": "The single season record is 73, set by Barry Bonds in 2001.  Other notable single season records were achieved by Babe Ruth who hit 60 in 1927, Roger Maris, with 61 home runs in 1961, and Mark McGwire, who hit 70 in 1998.\n\nNegro League slugger Josh Gibson's Baseball Hall of Fame plaque says he hit \"almost 800\" home runs in his career. The Guinness Book of World Records lists Gibson's lifetime home run total at 800. Ken Burns' award-winning series, Baseball, states that his actual total may have been as high as 950. Gibson's true total is not known, in part due to inconsistent record keeping in the Negro Leagues. The 1993 edition of the MacMillan Baseball Encyclopedia attempted to compile a set of Negro League records, and subsequent work has expanded on that effort. Those records demonstrate that Gibson and Ruth were of comparable power. The 1993 book had Gibson hitting 146 home runs in the 501 \"official\" Negro League games they were able to account for in his 17-year career, about 1 homer every 3.4 games. Babe Ruth, in 22 seasons (several of them in the dead-ball era), hit 714 in 2503 games, or 1 homer every 3.5 games. The large gap in the numbers for Gibson reflect the fact that Negro League clubs played relatively far fewer league games and many more \"barnstorming\" or exhibition games during the course of a season, than did the major league clubs of that era.\nMark David \"Big Mac\" McGwire (born October 1, 1963), is an American former professional baseball player and currently a bench coach  in Major League Baseball (MLB). As a first baseman, his MLB career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the Oakland Athletics and the St. Louis Cardinals. He quickly grabbed media attention in 1987 as a rookie with the Athletics by hitting 33 home runs before the All-Star break, and would lead the major leagues in home runs that year with 49, setting the single-season rookie record. He appeared in six straight All-Star Games from 1987 to 1992 despite a brief career decline related to injuries. Another string of six consecutive All-Star appearances followed from 1995 to 2001. Each season from 1996 to 1999, he again led the major leagues in home runs.\n\nA part of the 1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase of Roger Maris' 61 with the Cardinals, McGwire set the major league single-season home run record with 70,  which Barry Bonds broke three years later with 73.   McGwire also led the league in runs batted in, twice in bases on balls and on-base percentage, and four times in slugging percentage. Injuries significantly cut into his playing time in 2000 and 2001 before factoring into his retirement. He finished with 583 home runs, which was fifth all-time when he retired.\n\nFor his career, McGwire averaged a home run once every 10.61 at bats, the best at bats per home run ratio in baseball history (Babe Ruth is second at 11.76). McGwire also holds the distinction of being the fastest player to hit 500 home runs, in only 5,487 at-bats.  In 2010, McGwire publicly admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during a large portion of his career.\n\nEarly years\n*September 4 \u2013 The New York Yankees win their 100th game of the season, defeating the Chicago White Sox 11\u20136, reaching that mark five days faster than the  Chicago Cubs and  Cleveland Indians.\n*September 5 \u2013 Mark McGwire becomes the third player in major league history to reach 60 home runs, as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-0.

    "question": "Who won baseball's first World Series of the 80s?",
    "answer": "Philadelphia Phillies",
    "evidence": "1980s\n\n1984: Anderson becomes first to win in both leagues\n\nThe 1984 Detroit Tigers gained distinction as just the third team in major league history (after the 1927 New York Yankees and 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers) to lead a season wire-to-wire, from opening day through their World Series victory.  In the process, Tigers' skipper Sparky Anderson became the first manager to win a World Series title in both leagues, having previously won in 1975 and 1976 with the Cincinnati Reds.\n\n1989: Earthquake\n\nWhen the 1989 World Series began, it was notable chiefly for being the first ever World Series matchup between the two San Francisco Bay Area teams, the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics. Oakland won the first two games at home, and the two teams crossed the bridge to San Francisco to play Game 3 on Tuesday, October 17. ABC's broadcast of Game 3 began at 5\u00a0pm local time, approximately 30 minutes before the first pitch was scheduled. At 5:04, while broadcasters Al Michaels and Tim McCarver were narrating highlights and the teams were warming up, the Loma Prieta earthquake occurred (having a surface-wave magnitude of 7.1 with an epicenter ten miles (16\u00a0km) northeast of Santa Cruz, California). The earthquake caused substantial property and economic damage in the Bay Area and killed 63 people. Television viewers saw the video signal deteriorate and heard Michaels say \"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth--\" before the feed from Candlestick Park was lost. Fans filing into the stadium saw Candlestick sway visibly during the quake. Television coverage later resumed, using backup generators, with Michaels becoming a news reporter on the unfolding disaster. Approximately 30 minutes after the earthquake, Commissioner Fay Vincent ordered the game to be postponed. Fans, workers, and the teams evacuated a blacked out (although still sunlit) Candlestick. Game 3 was finally played on October 27, and Oakland won that day and the next to complete a four-game sweep.\n\n1990s\nGame 6\n\nTuesday, October 21, 1980 at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia\n\nGame 6 would be the culmination of the first Phillies championship ever. Philadelphia scored two in the third on a Mike Schmidt single. It was all that Steve Carlton and Tug McGraw would need for the 4\u20131 win. Kansas City threatened by loading the bases in the eighth and the ninth.  However, in the final frame, a foul popup by Frank White near the first base dugout came out of Phillies catcher Bob Boone's glove only to be caught by Pete Rose, who came right by Boone's side.  Then McGraw struck out Willie Wilson for the third and final out. It was the 12th time Wilson struck out in this Series, setting a new World Series record. The previous mark had been eleven, jointly held by Eddie Mathews and Wayne Garrett in  and , respectively. Ryan Howard would break Wilson's record by striking out 13 times in the 2009 World Series, ironically on a Phillies team which lost to the New York Yankees.\n\nBoone's knees were so sore by the end of the World Series that he could barely make it to the mound after the final out was recorded.\n\nWhen the modern-day World Series began in 1903, the National and American Leagues each had eight teams. With their victory in the 1980 World Series, the Phillies became the last of the \"Original Sixteen\" franchises to win a Series (although it should be noted that the St. Louis Browns never won a Series in St. Louis, having to wait until 1966, twelve years after they had become the Baltimore Orioles).\n\nWhile Mike Schmidt was the official MVP of the 1980 World Series, the Babe Ruth Award (another World Series MVP) was given to Tug McGraw.\n\n[http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/baseballs_best/mlb_bb_gamepage.jsp?story_page=bb_80ws_gm6_kcaphi mlb.com coverage of Game 6]\n\nComposite box\n\n1980 World Series (4\u20132): Philadelphia Phillies (N.L.) over Kansas City Royals (A.L.)\n\nBroadcasting",

    "evidence": "Sampras was known for his natural attacking serve-and-volley game, all-round game, and strong competitive instinct. Sampras's best surface was undoubtedly the fast-playing grass courts,  Sampras won seven Wimbledon titles (1993\u201395, 1997-2000), broken only by a loss in the 1996 quarterfinals to eventual winner Richard Krajicek, tying him with William Renshaw and Roger Federer for the most titles in Wimbledon history.  Sampras also shares the record of five US Open titles in the Open Era with Jimmy Connors and Federer. He won back-to-back US Open titles in 1995 and 1996, despite vomiting on the court at 1\u20131 in the final set tiebreak due to dehydration in the 1996 quarterfinals against \u00c0lex Corretja. Combined with his two Australian Open titles, this gave Sampras a total of fourteen majors won on grass and hard courts.\n\nSampras's only real weakness was on clay courts, where the slow surface tempered his natural attacking serve-and-volley game. His best performance at the French Open came in 1996, when he lost a semifinal match to the eventual winner, Yevgeny Kafelnikov. Despite his limited success at Roland Garros, Sampras did win some significant matches on clay. He won a 1992 clay court tournament in Kitzb\u00fchel, defeating Alberto Mancini in the final. He won the prestigious Italian Open in 1994, defeating Boris Becker in the final, and two singles matches in the 1995 Davis Cup final against Russians Andrei Chesnokov and Yevgeny Kafelnikov in Moscow. Sampras also won a 1998 clay court tournament in Atlanta, defeating Jason Stoltenberg in the final.\n\nPost-retirement activity\n\nOn April 6, 2006, three and a half years after his retirement, Sampras resurfaced and played his first exhibition match in River Oaks, Houston, Texas, against 23-year-old Robby Ginepri. Ginepri won the match in two sets. Sampras later announced that he would be playing in World Team Tennis events.\nUSTA National Tennis Center\n\nIn 1978 the tournament moved from the West Side Tennis Club, Forest Hills, Queens to the larger USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, three miles to the north. In the process, the tournament switched the court surface from clay, used in the last three years at Forest Hills, to hard courts. Jimmy Connors is the only individual to have won US Open singles titles on all three surfaces (grass, clay, hardcourt), while Chris Evert is the only woman to win on two surfaces (clay, hardcourt).\n\nThe US Open is the only Grand Slam tournament that has been played every year since its inception. \n\nFrom 1984 through 2015, the U.S. Open deviated from traditional scheduling practices for tennis tournaments with a concept that came to be known as \"Super Saturday\", in which the Women's final was held on Saturday, in between the two Men's semi-finals. The men's final was held the next day, on Sunday. While intended to help build a television audience, this scheduling pattern proved divisive, as the men's and women's semifinals were held on the day prior to their respective finals, thus only giving players less than a day's rest before the final. For five consecutive tournaments between 2007 through 2012, the Men's final had been postponed to Monday due to weather. The USTA decided to intentionally schedule the Men's final on Monday in 2013 and 2014, although this move drew the ire of the ATP for further deviating from the structure of the other Grand Slams.\n\nBeginning in 2015, the tournament has restored a traditional scheduling pattern, with the Men's final played on a Sunday; however, weather delays forced both sets of semi-finals to be held on Friday that year.\n\nPlayer challenges of line calls",

He offered the Senators $60,000 for Walter Johnson, but Washington owner Clark Griffith was unwilling. Even so, Frazee was successful in bringing other players to Boston, especially as replacements for players in the military. This willingness to spend for players helped the Red Sox secure the 1918 title.  The 1919 season saw record-breaking attendance, and Ruth's home runs for Boston made him a national sensation. In March 1919 Ruth was reported as having accepted a three-year contract for a total of $27,000, after protracted negotiations  Nevertheless, on December 26, 1919, Frazee sold Ruth's contract to the New York Yankees. \n\nNot all of the circumstances concerning the sale are known, but brewer and former congressman Jacob Ruppert, the New York team's principal owner, reportedly asked Yankee manager Miller Huggins what the team needed to be successful. \"Get Ruth from Boston\", Huggins supposedly replied, noting that Frazee was perennially in need of money to finance his theatrical productions.

    "question": "Which future Hollywood star got her break as Wonder Girl, Wonder Woman's sister Drusilla?",

    "evidence": "Alternate versions\n\n*A figure resembling Winger's Drusilla made a cameo appearance in Infinite Crisis #6, as the Wonder Girl of Earth-462. In other media\n\nWonder Woman\n\nIn 1976, a version of Wonder Girl (Drusilla instead of Donna Troy) appeared in the Wonder Woman television series and was played by Debra Winger.\n\nAlthough the pilot episode revealed that Wonder Woman's alter-ego, Princess Diana of Paradise Island, was Queen Hippolyta's only child, later episodes featured Diana's younger sibling, Drusilla.\n\nThis version of Drusilla was different than the one-time character in the comics. She was heavily modified for the TV Series.\n\nDrusilla first appeared in the two-part episode The Feminum Mystique. In that episode, Queen Hippolyta (Carolyn Jones) sends Drusilla to America in order to bring her sister home to Paradise Island. (It should be noted that Queen Hippolyta is never referred to by name in any of the televised specials in which she appeared.)\n\nDrusilla gets tangled up in a Nazi plot to discover the secret of Wonder Woman's magical bracelets, and in the process masters the spinning transformation used by her older sister. Although Drusilla creates the persona of Wonder Girl, the distinction is lost on the Nazis, who believe her to be Wonder Woman and abduct her.\n\nDrusilla appeared again in the final episode of the first season Wonder Woman in Hollywood. A Wonder Girl series was in development when actress Debra Winger broke her contract and left the series.\n\nTrivia\n\nIn the comics, Drusilla was a regular amazon who appeared in Wonder Woman #182, 1969 who was an ally to Wonder Woman. The Debra Winger version of Drusilla made a cameo appearance in Infinite Crisis #6, as the Wonder Girl of Earth-462. Cassandra Sandsmark would later adapt the alias of Drusilla as Drusilla Priam temporarily to protect her identity.",

Henman seemed slugglish compared to his first-round match and threw away serving for the first set. \n\nHenman played his final match in the Davis Cup tie against Croatia on 22 September 2007. The doubles match with Jamie Murray was played on Court 1 at Wimbledon which they won, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 7\u20136, 7\u20135. The match put Great Britain in an unassailable 3\u20130 lead and back in the World Group, with the doubles win being added to singles wins the previous day from Henman and Andy Murray. After the match Henman told Sue Barker in an interview on BBC Television and in front of the Court 1 crowd, \"It's occasions like this and fans like this that I will miss so much\".\n\nAt the time of his retirement, Henman had already committed to playing a Charity Exhibition at London's Royal Albert Hall during the Seniors Tennis Event The Blackrock Masters in December 2007.

He used Slazenger Pro Braided racquets.\nFrom 2009, a new No. 2 Court is being used at Wimbledon with a capacity for 4,000 people. To obtain planning permission, the playing surface is around 3.5m below ground level, ensuring that the single-storey structure is only about 3.5m above ground level, and thus not affecting local views.  Plans to build on the current site of Court 13 were dismissed due to the high capacity of games played at the 2012 Olympic Games. The old No.2 Court has been renamed as No.3 Court. The old No.2 Court was known as the \"Graveyard of Champions\" because many highly seeded players were eliminated there during early rounds over the years, including Ilie N\u0103stase, John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.

Under its leadership, China developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons.  The Chinese population almost doubled from around 550 million to over 900 million.  However, Mao's Great Leap Forward, a large-scale economic and social reform project, resulted in an estimated 45\u00a0million deaths between 1958 and 1961, mostly from starvation.  In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution, sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval which lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In October 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China in the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council. \n\nIn 1976, Mao died. The Gang of Four was quickly arrested and held responsible for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. In 1978 Deng Xiaoping took power and instituted significant economic reforms. The Communist Party loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives, and the communes were gradually disbanded in favour of private land leases. This marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment.  China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982.

    "question": "How many of his 45 races did Mike Hawthorn, a former Formula One motor racing world champion, win?",
    "answer": "Three",
    "evidence": "1955 24 Hours of Le Mans\n\nIn January 1955, Hawthorn joined the Jaguar racing team, replacing Stirling Moss, who had left for Mercedes.  Hawthorn won the 1955 les 24 Heures du Mans following what has been described as an inspired drive in which he set a lap record of 122.388\u00a0mph during a three-hour duel with Fangio in the early stages. The race was marred by the worst disaster in motor racing history - a crash which killed 84 spectators and driver Pierre Levegh, after Hawthorn had suddenly braked in front of Lance Macklin's Healey after overtaking him to enter the pits, causing Macklin to swerve into the path of Levegh's Mercedes. After colliding with the Healey, the Mercedes skipped the earthen embankment separating the spectator area from the track, bounced through spectator enclosures, then hit a concrete stairwell structure head-on. The impact shattered the front end of the car, which then somersaulted high, pitching debris into the spectator area, before landing atop the earthen embankment. The debris, including bonnet, engine, and front axle, which separated from the frame, flew through the crowd. Eight hours later, while leading the race 1.5 laps ahead of the Jaguar team, the Mercedes team withdrew from the race, ostensibly as a mark of respect for those who had perished in the accident; the Jaguar team was invited to join them but declined.  The French press carried photographs of Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb celebrating their win with the customary champagne but treated them with scorn. The official inquiry into the accident ruled that Hawthorn was not responsible for the crash, and that it was merely a racing incident. The death of the spectators was blamed on inadequate safety standards for track design.  The Grandstand and pit areas were demolished and rebuilt soon after. The death toll led to a ban on motorsports in France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and other nations, until the tracks could be brought to a higher safety standard.\nDrivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from 1984 to 2008 and the teams themselves won every Constructors' Championship from 1979 to 2008. Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically. This increased financial burdens, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive, but to stay in business, and forced several teams to withdraw. Since 1990, twenty-eight teams have withdrawn from Formula One. This has prompted former Jordan owner Eddie Jordan to say that the days of competitive privateers are over. \n\nManufacturers' return\n\nMichael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000\u20132004) and six consecutive constructors' championships (1999\u20132004). Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91), wins in a season (thirteen of eighteen), and most Drivers' Championships (seven).  Schumacher's championship streak ended on 25 September 2005 when Renault driver Fernando Alonso became Formula One's youngest champion at that time. During 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again. Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after sixteen years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team for three seasons.\nThe Formula One World Drivers' Championship (WDC) is awarded by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to the most successful Formula One racing car driver over a season, as determined by a points system based on Grand Prix results.\n\nThe Drivers' Championship was first awarded in 1950, to Giuseppe Farina. The first driver to win multiple Championships was Alberto Ascari, in 1952 and 1953. The current Drivers' Champion is Lewis Hamilton, who won his first World Championship in 2008, regained it in 2014 and retained it in 2015, the sixteenth time a British driver has won the title (a record). He is the ninth of ten Britons to win the title (another record), with Jenson Button succeeding him in 2009 after his first championship.\n\nA driver becomes the World Champion each season as soon as it is no longer mathematically possible for another to beat him whatever the outcome of the remaining races. The Drivers' Championship has been won in the final race of the season 28 times in the 66 seasons it has been awarded. The earliest in a season that the Drivers' Championship has been clinched was in 2002, when Michael Schumacher secured the title with six races remaining.\n\nOverall, thirty-two different drivers have won the Championship, with German Michael Schumacher holding the record for most titles, at seven. Schumacher also holds the record for most consecutive Drivers' Championships, winning five from 2000 to 2004. The United Kingdom has produced the most World Championship winning drivers with ten; Brazil and Finland are next with three each. Of the 32 drivers to win the World Championship, 20 are still alive. The most recently deceased is Sir Jack Brabham (1926\u20132014). Among teams, Scuderia Ferrari has produced the most World Championship winning drivers with 15.\n\n__TOC__\n\nBy season \n\nNotes",

    "question": "In which country did the Internet start?",
    "answer": "USA",
    "evidence": "Finland has the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita in the world. Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers.  In the US, public library users have borrowed on average roughly 15 books per user per year from 1856 to 1978. From 1978 to 2004, book circulation per user declined approximately 50%. The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline.[http://galbithink.org/libraries/circulation.htm Statistics on Book Circulation Per User of U.S. Public Libraries Since 1856] from galbithink.org\n\nShift to digital libraries\n\nIn the 21st century there has been increasing use of the Internet to gather and retrieve data. The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the way people use physical libraries. Between 2002 and 2004, the average American academic library saw the overall number of transactions decline approximately 2.2%.  Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new generation of students that are used to having information just one click away. For example, the University of California Library System saw a 54% decline in circulation between 1991 and 2001 of 8,377,000 books to 3,832,000. \n\nThese facts might be a consequence of the increased availability of e-resources. In 1999\u20132000, 105 ARL university libraries spent almost $100 million on electronic resources, which is an increase of nearly $23 million from the previous year.  A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8 million in revenue.   Another example of the shift to digital libraries can be seen in Cushing Academy\u2019s decision to dispense with its library of printed books\u2014more than 20,000 volumes in all\u2014and switch over entirely to digital media resources.\nIn 1988, Daniel Karrenberg, from Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, visited Ben Segal, CERN's TCP/IP Coordinator, looking for advice about the transition of the European side of the UUCP Usenet network (much of which ran over X.25 links) over to TCP/IP. In 1987, Ben Segal had met with Len Bosack from the then still small company Cisco about purchasing some TCP/IP routers for CERN, and was able to give Karrenberg advice and forward him on to Cisco for the appropriate hardware. This expanded the European portion of the Internet across the existing UUCP networks, and in 1989 CERN opened its first external TCP/IP connections.  This coincided with the creation of R\u00e9seaux IP Europ\u00e9ens (RIPE), initially a group of IP network administrators who met regularly to carry out coordination work together. Later, in 1992, RIPE was formally registered as a cooperative in Amsterdam.\n\nAt the same time as the rise of internetworking in Europe, ad hoc networking to ARPA and in-between Australian universities formed, based on various technologies such as X.25 and UUCPNet. These were limited in their connection to the global networks, due to the cost of making individual international UUCP dial-up or X.25 connections. In 1989, Australian universities joined the push towards using IP protocols to unify their networking infrastructures. AARNet was formed in 1989 by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee and provided a dedicated IP based network for Australia.\n\nThe Internet began to penetrate Asia in the 1980s. In May 1982 South Korea became the second country to successfully set up TCP/IP IPv4 network.   Japan, which had built the UUCP-based network JUNET in 1984, connected to NSFNET in 1989. It hosted the annual meeting of the Internet Society, INET'92, in Kobe.

It is widely regarded as one of the world's leading music schools, with some of the most prestigious arts programs.   \n\nHistory\n\nIn 1905, the Institute of Musical Art was founded on the premise that the United States did not have a premier music school and too many students were going to Europe to study music.  At its formation, the Institute was located in Manhattan at Fifth Avenue and 12th Street. During its first year, the institute enrolled 500 students. It moved in 1910 to Claremont Avenue in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, onto a property purchased from Bloomingdale Insane Asylum.   In 1920, the Juilliard Foundation was created, named after textile merchant Augustus D. Juilliard, who bequeathed a substantial amount of money for the advancement of music in the United States. In 1924, the foundation purchased the Vanderbilt family guesthouse at 49 East 52nd Street to start the Juilliard Graduate School.  In 1926, it merged partially with the Institute of Musical Art with a common president, the Columbia University professor John Erskine. The schools had separate deans and identities. The conductor and music-educator Frank Damrosch continued as the Institute's dean, and the Australian pianist and composer Ernest Hutcheson was appointed dean of the Graduate School. In 1937, Hutcheson succeeded Erskine as president of the two institutions, a job he held until 1945. In 1946, the combined schools were named the Juilliard School of Music. The president of the school at that time was William Schuman, the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Music. In 1951, the school added a dance division, directed by Martha Hill.",

The band was a pioneer in the early American new wave and punk scenes of the mid-late 1970s. Its first two albums contained strong elements of these genres, and although successful in the United Kingdom and Australia, Blondie was regarded as an underground band in the United States until the release of Parallel Lines in 1978. Over the next three years, the band achieved several hit singles  including \"Call Me\", \"Atomic\" and \"Heart of Glass\" and became noted for its eclectic mix of musical styles incorporating elements of disco, pop, reggae, and early rap music.\n\nBlondie broke up after the release of its sixth studio album The Hunter in 1982. Debbie Harry continued to pursue a solo career with varied results after taking a few years off to care for partner Chris Stein, who was diagnosed with pemphigus, a rare autoimmune disease of the skin.

    "answer": "Red sea",
    "evidence": "Suez Canal\n\nThere was a canal from the Nile delta to the Gulf of Suez in ancient times, when the gulf extended further north than it does today. This fell into disuse, and the present canal was built in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe Suez Canal offers a significantly shorter passage for ships than passing round the Cape of Good Hope. The construction of the Suez Canal was favoured by the natural conditions of the region: the comparatively short distance between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the occurrence of a line of lakes or depressions which became lakes (Lake Manzala in the north, and depressions, Timsah and the Bitter Lakes, part way along the route), and the generally flat terrain. The construction of the canal was proposed by the engineer and French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, who acquired from Said Pasha the rights of constructing and operating the canal for a period of 99 years. The Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez was formed. Construction took 11 years, and the canal opened on 17 November 1869. The canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on world trade.\n\nIn July 1956, just a few days after the fourth anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Egyptian government under President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal Company, which had been run by the French and owned privately, with the British as the largest shareholders. The Israeli-British-French invasion of Egypt which followed is known in Egypt as the Tripartite Aggression but elsewhere as the Suez Crisis. Following Israel's invasion and occupation of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula in the Six Day War of 1967, the Canal was closed, and did not reopen until 1975.\n\nToday, the Canal is a vital link in world trade, and contributes significantly to the Egyptian economy; in 2009 the income generated from the canal accounted for 3.7% of Egypt's GDP. \n\nClimate\n\nK\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as a hot desert (BWh).\nFollowing the 2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck, the Italian government decided to strengthen the national system for the patrolling of the Mediterranean Sea by authorising \"Mare Nostrum\", a military and humanitarian mission in order to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers of immigrants. \n\nGeography\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar (known in Homer's writings as the \"Pillars of Hercules\") in the west and to the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea, by the Dardanelles and the Bosporus respectively, in the east. The Sea of Marmara is often considered a part of the Mediterranean Sea, whereas the Black Sea is generally not. The 163 km long artificial Suez Canal in the southeast connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea.\n\nLarge islands in the Mediterranean include Cyprus, Crete, Euboea, Rhodes, Lesbos, Chios, Kefalonia, Corfu, Limnos, Samos, Naxos and Andros in the Eastern Mediterranean; Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, Cres, Krk, Bra\u010d, Hvar, Pag, Kor\u010dula and Malta in the central Mediterranean; and Ibiza, Majorca and Minorca (the Balearic Islands) in the Western Mediterranean.\n\nThe typical Mediterranean climate has hot, humid, and dry summers and mild, rainy winters.

    "evidence": "To sponsor more uprisings, Sun made a personal plea for financial aid at the Penang conference held on 13 November 1910 in Malaya.Berg\u00e8re: 188  The leaders launched a major drive for donations across the Malay Peninsula.  They raised HK$187,000.\n\nOn 27 April 1911, revolutionary Huang Xing led a second Guangzhou uprising known as the Yellow Flower Mound revolt against the Qing.  The revolt failed and ended in disaster; the bodies of only 72 revolutionaries were found.   The revolutionaries are remembered as martyrs.\n\nOn 10 October 1911, a military uprising at Wuchang took place led again by Huang Xing.  At the time, Sun had no direct involvement as he was still in exile.  Huang was in charge of the revolution that ended over 2000 years of imperial rule in China.  When Sun learned of the successful rebellion against the Qing emperor from press reports, he immediately returned to China from the United States accompanied by his American military advisor, \"General\" Homer Lea, on 21 December 1911. \n\nThe uprising expanded to the Xinhai Revolution also known as the \"Chinese Revolution\" to overthrow the last Emperor Puyi.  After this event, 10 October became known as the commemoration of Double Ten Day. \n\nRepublic of China with many governments\n\nProvisional government\nOutside Japan, beginning with Emperor Sh\u014dwa, the Emperors are often referred to by their given names, both whilst alive and posthumously. For example, the previous Emperor is usually called Hirohito in English, although he was never referred to as Hirohito in Japan, and was renamed Sh\u014dwa Tenn\u014d after his death, which is the only name that Japanese speakers currently use when referring to him.\n\nThe current Emperor on the throne is typically referred to by the title Tenn\u014d Heika (\u5929\u7687\u965b\u4e0b, literally \"His Majesty the Emperor\"), Kinj\u014d Heika (\u4eca\u4e0a\u965b\u4e0b, literally \"His Current Majesty\") or simply Tenn\u014d, when speaking Japanese. The current Emperor will be renamed Heisei Tenn\u014d (\u5e73\u6210\u5929\u7687) after his death and will then be referred to exclusively by that name in Japanese. Non-Japanese speakers typically refer to him as Emperor Akihito, and will almost certainly continue to do so after his death. It is considered a major faux pas to refer to a living Emperor by his posthumous name.\n\nOrigin of the title\n\nOriginally, the ruler of Japan was known as either \u5927\u548c\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b (Yamato-\u014dkimi, Grand King of Yamato), \u502d\u738b/\u502d\u56fd\u738b (Wa-\u014d/Wakoku-\u014d, King of Wa, used externally) or \u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b (Ame-no-shita shiroshimesu \u014dkimi or Sumera no mikoto, Grand King who rules all under heaven, used internally) in Japanese and Chinese sources prior to the 7th century. The oldest documented use of the word \"Tenn\u014d\" is on a wooden slat, or mokkan, that was unearthed in Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture in 1998 and dated back to the reign of Emperor Temmu and Empress Jit\u014d.\n\nMarriage traditions\n\nThroughout history, Japanese Emperors and noblemen appointed the position of chief wife, rather than just keeping a harem or an assortment of female attendants.\nBelgium is a classic example of a state that is not a nation state. The state was formed by secession from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1830, whose neutrality and integrity was protected by the Treaty of London 1839; thus it served as a buffer state after the Napoleonitic Wars between the European powers France, Prussia (after 1871 the German Empire) and the United Kingdom  until World War I, when its neutrality was breached by the Germans. Currently, Belgium is divided between the Flemings in the north and the French-speaking or the German-speaking population in the south. The Flemish population in the north speaks Dutch, the Walloon population in the south speaks French and/or German. The Brussels population speaks French and/or Dutch.\n\nThe Flemish identity is also cultural, and there is a strong separatist movement espoused by the political parties, the right-wing Vlaams Belang and the Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie. The Francophone Walloon identity of Belgium is linguistically distinct and regionalist. There is also unitary Belgian nationalism, several versions of a Greater Netherlands ideal, and a German-speaking community of Belgium annexed from Germany in 1920, and re-annexed by Germany in 1940\u20131944. However these ideologies are all very marginal and politically insignificant during elections.\n\nChina covers a large geographic area and uses the concept of \"Zhonghua minzu\" or Chinese nationality, in the sense of ethnic groups, but it also officially recognizes the majority Han ethnic group which accounts for over 90% of the population, and no fewer than 55 ethnic national minorities.",

    "question": "Which Palestinian co-founded al Fatah in 1957?",
    "answer": "Yasser Arafat",
    "evidence": "1967\u2013present\n\nSince 1967, Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have lived under military occupation, creating, according to Avram Bornstein, a carceralization of their society.   In the meantime, pan-Arabism has waned as an aspect of Palestinian identity. The Israeli capture of the Gaza Strip and West Bank triggered a second Palestinian exodus and fractured Palestinian political and militant groups, prompting them to give up residual hopes in pan-Arabism. They rallied increasingly around the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had been formed in Cairo in 1964. The group grew in popularity in the following years, especially under the nationalistic orientation of the leadership of Yasser Arafat.The PNC adopted the goal of establishing a national state in 1974. Mainstream secular Palestinian nationalism was grouped together under the umbrella of the PLO whose constituent organizations include Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, among other groups who at that time believed that political violence was the only way to \"liberate\" Palestine. These groups gave voice to a tradition that emerged in the 1960s that argues Palestinian nationalism has deep historical roots, with extreme advocates reading a Palestinian nationalist consciousness and identity back into the history of Palestine over the past few centuries, and even millennia, when such a consciousness is in fact relatively modern.Khalidi, 1997, p. 149. Khalidi writes: 'As with other national movements, extreme advocates of this view go further than this, and anachronistically read back into the history of Palestine over the past few centuries, and even millennia, a nationalist consciousness and identity that are in fact relatively modern.'\nFata\u1e25 ( '), formerly the Palestinian National Liberation Movement  (), is a secular Palestinian political party and the largest faction of the confederated multi-party Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\n\nFatah is generally considered to have had a strong involvement in revolutionary struggle in the past and has maintained a number of militant groups.      Fatah had been closely identified with the leadership of its founder Yasser Arafat, until his death in 2004. Since Arafat's departure, factionalism within the ideologically diverse movement has become more apparent.\n\nIn the 2006 parliamentary election, the party lost its majority in the Palestinian parliament to Hamas. However, the Hamas legislative victory led to a conflict between Fatah and Hamas, with Fatah retaining control of the Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe full name of the movement is \u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u1e25arakat al-ta\u1e25r\u012br al-wa\u1e6dan\u012b al-Filas\u1e6d\u012bn\u012b, meaning the \"Palestinian National Liberation Movement\". From this was crafted the reverse acronym Fat\u1e25 (Fatah) meaning \"opening\", \"conquering\", or \"victory\".  The word \"fat\u1e25\" or \"fatah\" is used in religious discourse to signify the Islamic expansion in the first centuries of Islamic history\u00a0\u2013as in Fat\u1e25 al-Sham, the \"conquering of the Levant\". \"Fatah\" also has religious significance in that it is the name of the 48th sura (chapter) of the Qu'ran which, according to major Muslim commentators, details the story of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. (During the peaceful two years after the Hudaybiyyah treaty, many converted to Islam, increasing the strength of the Muslim side. It was the breach of this treaty by the Quraish  that triggered the conquest of Mecca. This Islamic precedent was cited by Yasser Arafat as justification for his signing the Oslo Accords with Israel.  \n\nStructure",

New Zealand, the Netherlands (mainly the Dutch East Indies), the Philippines, United Kingdom, and other Allied nations also contributed forces.\n\nThe South Pacific became a major theatre of the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Initially, US warplans called for a counteroffensive across the Central Pacific, but this was disrupted by the loss of battleships at Pearl Harbor. During the First South Pacific Campaign, US forces sought to establish a defensive perimeter against additional Japanese attacks. This was followed by the Second South Pacific Campaign, which began with the battle of Guadalcanal. \n\nAllied command",

    "question": "What percentage of the earth's surface is covered by Europe?",
    "answer": "8%",
    "evidence": "Surface\n\nEarth has a total surface area of about  (197 million sq mi). About 70.8% of the surface is covered by water, with much of the continental shelf below sea level. This equates to  (139.43 million sq mi).  The submerged surface has mountainous features, including a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system, as well as undersea volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus and abyssal plains. The remaining 29.2% (, or 57.51 million sq mi) not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms.\n\nEarth's surface undergoes reshaping over geological time periods due to tectonics and erosion. The surface features built up or deformed through plate tectonics are subject to steady weathering and erosion from precipitation, thermal cycles, and chemical effects. Glaciation, coastal erosion, the build-up of coral reefs, and large meteorite impacts also act to reshape the landscape.\n\nThe continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine. Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.\nEurope is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.  Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europe\u2014a concept dating back to classical antiquity\u2014are arbitrary; the primarily physiographic term \"continent\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current boundaries.\n\nEurope is the world's second-smallest continent by surface area, covering about  or 2% of the Earth's surface and about 6.8% of its land area. Of Europe's approximately 50 countries, Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population, while Vatican City is the smallest both in terms of area and population. Europe is the third-most populous continent after Asia and Africa, with a population of 739\u2013743\u00a0million or about 11% of the world's population.  Europe has a climate heavily affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the Atlantic, seasonal differences are mildly greater than close to the coast.",

    "question": "Who first drew Mickey Mouse when ?Disney first supplied the voice?",
    "answer": "Ub Iwerks",
    "evidence": "In the spring of 1928, Disney asked Ub Iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of various animals, such as dogs and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were also rejected. They would later turn up as Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. A male frog was also rejected. It would later show up in Iwerks' own Flip the Frog series.  Walt Disney got the inspiration for Mickey Mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri.  In 1925, Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney. These inspired Ub Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney. \"Mortimer Mouse\" had been Disney's original name for the character before his wife, Lillian, convinced him to change it, and ultimately Mickey Mouse came to be.   The actor Mickey Rooney claimed that, during his Mickey McGuire days, he met cartoonist Walt Disney at the Warner Brothers studio, and that Disney was inspired to name Mickey Mouse after him.  This claim however has been debunked by Disney historian Jim Korkis, since at the time of Mickey Mouse's development, Disney Studios had been located on Hyperion Avenue for several years, and Walt Disney never kept an office or other working space at Warner Brothers, having no professional relationship with Warner Brothers, as the Alice Comedies and Oswald cartoons were distributed by Universal.  \n\nDesign\n1928\u201334: Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies \n\nIn 1928, to recover from the loss of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney came up with the idea of a mouse character named Mortimer while on a train headed to California, drawing up a few simple drawings.  The mouse was later renamed Mickey Mouse (Disney's wife, Lillian, disliked the sound of 'Mortimer Mouse') and starred in several Disney produced films. Ub Iwerks refined Disney's initial design of Mickey Mouse.  Disney's first sound film Steamboat Willie, a cartoon starring Mickey, was released on November 18, 1928 through Pat Powers' distribution company. It was the first Mickey Mouse sound cartoon released, but the third to be created, behind Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho. Steamboat Willie was an immediate smash hit, and its initial success was attributed not just to Mickey's appeal as a character, but to the fact that it was the first cartoon to feature synchronized sound.  Disney used Pat Powers' Cinephone system, created by Powers using Lee De Forest's Phonofilm system. Steamboat Willie premiered at B. S. Moss's Colony Theater in New York City, now The Broadway Theatre.  Disney's Plane Crazy and The Galloping Gaucho were then retrofitted with synchronized sound tracks and re-released successfully in 1929.",

After purchasing a ticket to the high school dance (with the winner receiving a Stray Cats album) she decided to attend.  This time she decided to wear a full-length dress and mentions how some folks changed, some for the good (Bobby Taylor, who repeatedly asked her for dates, was now paying attention to his wife, while Mr. Harper and Shirley Thompson became sober and later married) and others for the bad (Mr. Kelly never stopped his alcohol abuse and died from cirrhosis as a result, while \"Widow Jones\" and an unnamed child died in a traffic accident as a result of her missing a curve due to speeding).\n\nHowever, she noticed prevalent substance abuse among the youth, and initially decided to get a gun, but decided to pray instead.  After remembering her own wild behavior, she decides to attend the PTA meeting the following day and share her concerns.\n\nChart performance\n\nCover versions\nThe success of \"Harper Valley PTA\"\n\n\"Harper Valley PTA\" was released in 1968. The song immediately became a hit for Riley and went to number one on both the Billboard Pop and Country charts, a feat not repeated until 1981 when Dolly Parton released \"9 to 5\". The song is about a widowed woman by the name of Mrs. Johnson, who confronts a group of members of the PTA after her daughter brings home a note from school that's critical of her (Mrs. Johnson's) habits of wearing miniskirts, going out with men, and other behavior of which they do not approve. The climax of the song comes when Mrs. Johnson turns the tables on the PTA and exposes their hypocrisy, one member at a time.\n\nRiley and the song became an overnight sensation, and the song earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and the Country Music Association 'Single of the Year' award.  Riley also became one of the few country artists ever nominated in the major pop Grammy Award categories of \"Best New Artist\" and \"Record of the Year\". Globally it sold over five and a half million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. just four weeks after the song's release. The album of the same name sold over one million units to gain a further gold disc for Riley. \n\nThe song was a phenomenon which led to Riley making country music history in 1969 as the first female vocalist to have her own major network variety special, Harper Valley U.S.A., which she hosted along with Jerry Reed and featured performances by Mel Tillis and the song's writer, Tom T. Hall. \n\nThe song spawned a 1978 film and a 1981-83 television series, both titled Harper Valley PTA and both starring Barbara Eden as the widow Mrs. Johnson.\n\nAfter \"Harper Valley PTA\"",

    "evidence": "Independent labels are often considered more artist-friendly. Though they may have less financial clout, indie labels typically offer larger artist royalty with 50% profit-share agreement, aka 50-50 deal, not uncommon. \n\nSublabel\n\nMusic collectors often use the term sublabel to refer to either an imprint or a subordinate label company (such as those within a group). For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, \"4th & B'way\" was a trademarked brand owned by Island Records Ltd. in the UK and by a subordinate branch, Island Records, Inc., in the United States. The center label on a 4th & Broadway record marketed in the United States would typically bear a 4th & B'way logo and would state in the fine print, \"4th & B'way\u2122, an Island Records, Inc. company\". Collectors discussing labels as brands would say that 4th & B'way is a sublabel or imprint of just \"Island\" or \"Island Records\". Similarly, collectors who choose to treat corporations and trademarks as equivalent might say 4th & B'way is an imprint and/or sublabel of both Island Records, Ltd. and that company's sublabel, Island Records, Inc. However, such definitions are complicated by the corporate mergers that occurred in 1989 (when Island was sold to PolyGram) and 1998 (when PolyGram merged with Universal). Island remained registered as corporations in both the United States and UK, but control of its brands changed hands multiple times as new companies were formed, diminishing the corporation's distinction as the \"parent\" of any sublabels.\n\nVanity labels",

    "answer": "Chess",
    "evidence": "Charles Edward Anderson \"Chuck\" Berry (born October 18, 1926) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as \"Maybellene\" (1955), \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957) and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music.Campbell, M. (ed.) (2008). Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes On. 3rd ed. Cengage Learning. pp. 168\u2013169.\n\nBorn into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high-school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded \"Maybellene\"\u2014Berry's adaptation of the country song \"Ida Red\"\u2014which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962, he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act\u2014he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.\nStax Records was founded in 1957 as Satellite Records. The label was a major factor in the creation of the Southern soul and Memphis soul styles.\n\nIn 1959, two black-owned record labels, one of which would become hugely successful, made their debut: Sam Cooke's Sar, and Berry Gordy's Motown Records. \n\nBlues\n\nBlues had a huge influence on mainstream American popular music in the 1950s with the enthusiastic playing styles of popular musicians like Bo Diddley  and Chuck Berry,  departed from the melancholy aspects of blues and influenced Rock and roll music.\n\nRay Charles and Fats Domino help bring blues into the popular music scene. Domino provides a boogie-woogie style that heavily influences rock 'n' roll.\n\nBig Mama Thornton records the original versions of \"Hound Dog\" and \"Ball and Chain\". \n\nCountry music \n\nCountry music stars in the early 1950s included Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Bill Monroe, Eddy Arnold, Gene Autry, Tex Ritter, Jim Reeves, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Chet Atkins and Kitty Wells.\n\nWells' 1952 hit \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" became the first single by a solo female artist to top the U.S. country charts. \"It Wasn't God ... \" was a landmark single in several ways; it began a trend of \"answer\" songs, or songs written and recorded in response to (or to counterpoint) a previously popular song \u2013 in this case, \"The Wild Side of Life\" by Hank Thompson \u2013 and for Wells, began a trend of female singers who defied the typical stereotype of being submissive to men and putting up with their oft-infidel ways, both in their personal lives and in their songs.\nLater incarnations\n\nIn the early 1980s, noticing that much of the Chess catalog was unavailable, Marshall Chess was able to convince Joe and Sylvia Robinson, who ran All Platinum, to re-issue the catalog themselves under his supervision (All Platinum had been licensing selected tracks out to other companies, which ultimately resulted in the disappearance of some original master tapes). The re-issued singles and LPs sold well, but by the mid-80s, All Platinum fell into financial difficulties and the Chess master recordings were acquired by MCA Records, which itself was later merged into Universal Music imprint, Geffen Records.\n\nIn February 1997, MCA started releasing eleven compilation albums for the 50th anniversary of Chess Records. \n\nIn the 1990s, MCA Records sued Charly Records for selling CDs which contained copyrighted material by Chess artists. \n\nIn the 2000s, Universal's limited-edition re-issue label, Hip-O Select began releasing a series of comprehensive box-sets devoted to such Chess artists as Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry.\n\nChess Records was the subject of two films produced in 2008, Cadillac Records and Who Do You Love?. In addition to the Chess brothers, both films feature portrayals of or based on Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf and Etta James. Cadillac Records was directed by Darnell Martin and features an ensemble cast including Adrien Brody, Mos Def, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Jeffrey Wright.

Such markings in Norway are indicated with numbers only, again different from international standards (90 means Slovakian -not Turkish as international telephone codes would mean-).\n\nThe allocation of codes is maintained by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe as the Distinguishing Signs Used on Vehicles in International Traffic  (sometimes abbreviated to DSIT), authorised by the UN's Geneva Convention on Road Traffic of 1949 and the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968. Many vehicle codes created since the adoption of ISO 3166 coincide with ISO two- or three-letter codes.\n\nThe 2004 South-East Asian Agreement\u00a0... for the Facilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People uses a mixture of ISO and DSIT codes: Myanmar uses MYA, China CHN, and Cambodia KH (ISO codes), Thailand uses T (DSIT code), Laos LAO, and Vietnam VN (coincident ISO and DSIT codes). \n\nIn the European Economic Area, vehicles from one member state do not need to display the oval while within another state, provided the number plate is in the common EU standard format introduced in the 1990s, which includes the international vehicle registration code on the plate. \n\nCurrent codes\n\nNote: an asterisk (*) indicates that this code is unofficial (does not appear in the UN list of distinguishing codes).\n\nCodes no longer in use\nType of plates\n\nThe colour of the license plate varies depending on the purpose of the vehicle (see chart below.)\n\nOld district plates\n\nThis system was used from 1938 until 31 December 1988 and consisted of a black plate with silver letters. The 1st letter denominated the district (except for military related) where the plate was issued as follows:\n  \t \n*A: Akureyrarkaupsta\u00f0ur og Eyjafjar\u00f0ars\u00fdsla\n*B: Bar\u00f0astrandars\u00fdsla\n*D: Dalas\u00fdsla\n*E: Akraneskaupsta\u00f0ur\n*F: Siglufjar\u00f0arkaupsta\u00f0ur\n*G: Hafnarfjar\u00f0arkaupsta\u00f0ur og Gullbringu- og Kj\u00f3sars\u00fdsla\n*H: H\u00fanavatnss\u00fdsla\n*\u00cd: \u00cdsafjar\u00f0arkaupsta\u00f0ur og \u00cdsafjar\u00f0ars\u00fdsla\n*J: \u00cdslenskir starfsmenn \u00e1 Keflav\u00edkurflugvelli e.

    "question": "Where was the American venue of the Live Aid concert?",
    "answer": "Philadelphia",
    "evidence": "Live Aid was a dual-venue concert held on 13 July 1985, and an ongoing music-based fundraising initiative. The original event was organised by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise funds for relief of the ongoing Ethiopian famine. Billed as the \"global jukebox\", the event was held simultaneously at Wembley Stadium in London, England, United Kingdom (attended by 72,000 people) and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States (attended by about 100,000 people). \n\nOn the same day, concerts inspired by the initiative happened in other countries, such as the Soviet Union, Japan, Austria, Australia and West Germany. It was one of the largest-scale satellite link-ups and television broadcasts of all time: an estimated global audience of 1.9 billion, across 150 nations, watched the live broadcast.\n\nBackground \n\nThe 1985 Live Aid concert was conceived as a follow-on to the successful charity single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" which was also the brainchild of Geldof and Ure. In October 1984, images of millions of people starving to death in Ethiopia were shown in the UK in Michael Buerk's BBC News reports on the 1984 famine.  Bob Geldof saw the report, and called Midge Ure from Ultravox, and together they quickly co-wrote the song, \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" in the hope of raising money for famine relief. Geldof then contacted colleagues in the music industry and persuaded them to record the single under the title 'Band Aid' for free. On 25 November 1984, the song was recorded at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, and was released four days later.   It stayed at number-one for five weeks in the UK, was Christmas number one, and became the fastest-selling single ever in Britain and raised \u00a38 million, rather than the \u00a370,000 Geldof and Ure had initially expected. Geldof then set his sights on staging a huge concert to raise further funds.",

    "question": "In WWII, who was the head of the Nazi party's security service?",
    "answer": "Reinhard Heidrich",
    "evidence": "Party composition\n\nCommand structure\n\nTop leadership\n\nAt the top of the Nazi Party was the party chairman (\"Der F\u00fchrer\"), who held absolute power and full command over the party. All other party offices were subordinate to his position and had to depend on his instructions. In 1934, Hitler founded a separate body for the chairman, Chancellery of the F\u00fchrer, with its own sub-units.\n\nBelow the F\u00fchrer's chancellery was first the \"Staff of the Deputy F\u00fchrer\", headed by Rudolf Hess from 21 April 1933 to 10 May 1941, and then the \"Party Chancellery\" (Parteikanzlei) headed by Martin Bormann.\n\nReichsleiter\n\nDirectly subjected to the F\u00fchrer were the Reichsleiter (\"Reich Leader(s)\"\u2014the singular and plural forms are identical in German), whose number was gradually increased to eighteen. They held power and influence comparable to the Reich Ministers' in Hitler's Cabinet. The eighteen Reichsleiter formed the \"Reich Leadership of the Nazi Party\" (Reichsleitung der NSDAP), which was established at the so-called Brown House, in Munich. Unlike a Gauleiter, a Reichsleiter did not have individual geographic areas under their command, but were responsible for specific spheres of interest.\n\nPolitical leadership corps\n\nThe political leadership corps of the Nazi Party were those persons who were most often associated as being \"Nazis\" in the stereotypical sense of the word, as it was these individuals who wore brown paramilitary Nazi uniforms, enforced Nazi doctrine, and ran local government affairs in accordance with instructions from the Nazi Party.\n\nThe political leadership corps encompassed a vast array of paramilitary titles at the top of which were Gauleiter, who were Party leaders of large geographical areas. From the Gauleiters extended downwards through Nazi positions encompassing county, city, and town leaders, all of whom were unquestioned rulers in their particular areas and regions.\nSicherheitsdienst (), full title Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsf\u00fchrers-SS (), or SD, was the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany.  The organization was the first Nazi Party intelligence organization to be established and was considered a sister organization with the Gestapo, which the SS had infiltrated heavily after 1934.  Between 1933 and 1939, the SD was administered as an independent SS office, after which it was transferred to the authority of the Reich Main Security Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt; RSHA), as one of its seven departments/offices.  Its first director, Reinhard Heydrich, intended for the SD to bring every single individual within the Third Reich's reach under \"continuous supervision.\" \n\nFollowing Germany's defeat in World War II, the SD was declared a criminal organisation at the Nuremberg Trials, along with the rest of Heydrich's RSHA (including the Gestapo) both individually and as branches of the SS in the collective.  Heydrich's successor, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, was sentenced to death for war crimes at the Nuremberg Tribunals and hanged in 1946.\n\nHistory\n\nThe SD was one of the oldest security organizations of the SS and was first formed in 1931 as the Ic-Dienst, operating out of a single apartment and reporting directly to Heinrich Himmler. Himmler appointed a former naval officer, Reinhard Heydrich, to organise the small agency. The office was renamed Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in the summer of 1932. The SD became more powerful after the Nazis took control of Germany and the SS started infiltrating all leading positions of the security apparatus of the Reich. Even before Hitler came to power, the SD was a veritable \"watchdog\" over the SS and members of the Nazi Party and played a critical role in consolidating political police powers into the hands of Himmler and Heydrich. \n\nGrowth of SD and SS power",

There are two variant of the name in official use: \"Malaca\u00f1ang Palace\" refers to the structure of the Palace, while \"Malaca\u00f1ang\" identifies the office of the President. The latter, along with the term \"the Palace\" (\"ang Palasyo\") are interchangeable, metonyms for the President and his household in colloquial speech and in the media.\n\nMalaca\u00f1ang Palace is depicted on the reverse side of the 20-peso bill in both the New Design and the present New Generation series.\n\nBahay Pangarap\n\nThis is the present resident of President Rodrigo Duterte during his presidency. \nThe actual residence of former President Benigno S. Aquino III is Bahay Pangarap (English: House of Dreams), a smaller structure located across the Pasig River from Malaca\u00f1ang Palace in Malaca\u00f1ang Park, which is itself part of the Presidential Security Group Complex. Aquino was the first President to live in Bahay Pangarap his official residence.\n\nMalaca\u00f1ang Park was originally built by former President Manuel L. Quezon as a rest house and venue for informal activities and social functions for the First Family. The house was built and designed by architect Juan Arellano in the 1930s, and underwent a number of renovations. In 2008, the house was demolished and rebuilt in contemporary style by architect Conrad Onglao, and a new swimming pool was built, replacing the Commonwealth Era one. The house originally had one bedroom, however, it was renovated for Aquino to have four bedrooms, a guest room, a room for his household staff, and a room for his close-in security. Malaca\u00f1ang Park was refurbished through the efforts of First Lady Eva Macapagal, the second wife of President Diosdado Macapagal, in the early 1960s. Mrs. Macapagal renamed the rest house as Bahay Pangarap.\nOf the individuals elected as president, three died in office: two of natural causes (Manuel L. Quezon and Manuel Roxas) and one on an aircraft disaster (Ramon Magsaysay (1953\u201357)).

    "answer": "Earthquake",
    "evidence": "Armenian mines produce copper, zinc, gold, and lead. The vast majority of energy is produced with fuel imported from Russia, including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant); the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric. Small deposits of coal, gas, and petroleum exist but have not yet been developed.\n\nLike other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, Armenia's economy suffers from the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the 1988 Spitak earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. The conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved. The closure of Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because Armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable. The GDP fell nearly 60% between 1989 and 1993, but then resumed robust growth. The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in 1993.\n\nNevertheless, the government was able to make wide-ranging economic reforms that paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth. The 1994 cease-fire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has also helped the economy. Armenia has had strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious-stone processing and jewellery making, information and communication technology, and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors of the economy, such as agriculture.",

An archaeological survey of the seafloor prior to construction of a natural gas pipeline led to the discoveries by C & C Marine archaeologists Robert A. Church and Daniel J. Warren. The sonar contacts consisted of two large sections lying approximately 500 feet apart at either end of a debris field that indicated the presence of a U-boat. \n\nGeography\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico's eastern, northern, and northwestern shores lie along the US states of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.  The US portion of the Gulf coastline spans 1680 mi, receiving water from 33 major rivers that drain 31 states.  The Gulf's southwestern and southern shores lie along the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucat\u00e1n, and the northernmost tip of Quintana Roo. The Mexican portion of the Gulf coastline spans 1,743 miles (2,805\u00a0km). On its southeast quadrant the Gulf is bordered by Cuba. It supports major American, Mexican and Cuban fishing industries. The outer margins of the wide continental shelves of Yucat\u00e1n and Florida receive cooler, nutrient-enriched waters from the deep by a process known as upwelling, which stimulates plankton growth in the euphotic zone.

After living at various addresses in London, the Crippens finally moved in 1905 to 39 Hilldrop Crescent, Camden Road, Holloway, London, where they took in lodgers to augment Crippen's meagre income.

    "question": "In the 1904 Olympics, how many of the 23 track and field titles were won by Americans?",
    "answer": "21",
    "evidence": "One of the most remarkable athletes was the American gymnast George Eyser, who won six medals even though his left leg was made of wood.\nFrank Kugler won four medals in freestyle wrestling, weightlifting and tug of war, making him the only competitor to win a medal in three different sports at the same Olympic Games.\nChicago runner James Lightbody won the steeplechase and the 800 m and then set a world record in the 1500 m. Harry Hillman won both the 200 m and 400 m hurdles and also the flat 400 m. Sprinter Archie Hahn was champion in the 60 m, 100 m and 200 m. In this last race, he set an Olympic record in 21.6, a record that stood for 28 years. In the discus, after American Martin Sheridan had thrown exactly the same distance as his compatriot, Ralph Rose (39.28 m), the judges gave them both an extra throw to decide the winner. Sheridan won the decider and claimed the gold medal. Ray Ewry again won all three standing jumps.\n\nThe team representing Great Britain was awarded a total of two medals, both won by Irish athletes. The top non-USA athlete was Emil Rausch of Germany, who won three swimming events. Zoltan Halmay of Hungary and Charles Daniels of the United States each won two swimming gold medals. Galt Football Club from Canada won the gold medal in football.\n\nMarathon\n\nThe marathon was the most bizarre event of the Games. It was run in brutally hot weather, over dusty roads, with horses and automobiles clearing the way and creating dust clouds. The first to arrive at the finish line was Frederick Lorz, who actually rode the rest of the way in a car to retrieve his clothes, after dropping out after nine miles. The car broke down at the 19th mile, so he re-entered the race and jogged back to the finish line. When the officials thought he had won the race, Lorz played along with his practical joke until he was found out shortly after the medal ceremony and was banned for a year by the AAU for this stunt, later winning the 1905 Boston Marathon.\nCombined events\n\nCombined (or multi-discipline) events are competitions in which athletes participate in a number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten events) and the women's heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.\n\nThe Ancient Olympic pentathlon (comprising long jump, javelin, discus, the stadion race and wrestling) was a precursor to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the 1906 Summer Olympics (Intercalated Games). A men's all-around was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics, contested between five American and two British athletes.\n\nStadium\n\nOutdoor\nYouth Games\n\nIn 2010, the Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games, which give athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. The Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president Jacques Rogge in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC.  The first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from 14\u201326 August 2010, while the inaugural Winter Games were hosted in Innsbruck, Austria, two years later.  These Games will be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, while the winter version will last nine days. The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games. The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events. \n\n21st-century games\n\nFrom 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, the Games have grown to about 10,500 competitors from 204 nations at the 2012 Summer Olympics.  The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller. For example, Sochi hosted 2,873 athletes from 88 nations competing in 98 events during the 2014 Winter Olympics.

Kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at Rice to promote the space effort on September 12, 1962, in which he said:\n \"No nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. ...\u00a0We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\"  \nOn November 21, 1962, in a cabinet meeting with NASA administrator Webb and other officials, Kennedy explained that the Moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige, and that the expense was justified.  Johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well. Costs for the Apollo program were expected to reach $40 billion.\n\nIn a September 1963 speech before the United Nations, Kennedy urged cooperation between the Soviets and Americans in space, specifically recommending that Apollo be switched to \"a joint expedition to the Moon\".  Khrushchev again declined, and the Soviets did not commit to a manned Moon mission until 1964. On July 20, 1969, almost six years after Kennedy's death, Apollo 11 landed the first manned spacecraft on the Moon.\n\nAssassination\n\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30\u00a0pm Central Standard Time on Friday November 22, 1963, while on a political trip to Texas to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph Yarborough and Don Yarborough (no relation) and conservative John Connally.  Traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown Dallas, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat,  and once in the head.\nChurch Committee\n\nChurch Committee is the common term referring to the 1975 United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, a U.S. Senate committee chaired by Senator Frank Church, to investigate the illegal intelligence gathering by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after the Watergate incident. It also investigated the CIA and FBI conduct relating to the JFK assassination.\n\nTheir report concluded that the investigation on the assassination by FBI and CIA were fundamentally deficient and the facts that have greatly affected the investigation had not been forwarded to the Warren Commission by the agencies. It also found that the FBI, the agency with primary responsibility on the matter, was ordered by Director Hoover and pressured by unnamed higher government officials to conclude its investigation quickly.  The report hinted that there was a possibility that senior officials in both agencies made conscious decisions not to disclose potentially important information. \n\nUnited States House Select Committee on Assassinations\n\nAs a result of increasing public and congressional skepticism regarding the Warren Commission's findings and the transparency of government agencies, House Resolution 1540 was passed in September 1976, creating the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) to investigate the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr..",

    "question": "Which caped crusader operated in Gotham City?",
    "answer": "Batman",
    "evidence": "Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger,   and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). Originally named the \"Bat-Man\", the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective. \n\nBatman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. After witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.  Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City, with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers; rather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective skills, science and technology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his archenemy, the Joker.\n\nBatman became popular soon after his introduction in 1939 and gained his own comic book title, Batman, the following year. As the decades went on, differing interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in 1986 with The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. The success of Warner Bros.' live-action Batman feature films have helped maintain public interest in the character.\nGeography\n\nGotham City's geography, like other fictional cities' geographies in the DC Universe, has varied over the decades, because of changing writers, editors, and storylines. The majority of appearances place Gotham on the Northeastern coast of the United States, where New York City is located. Also, Manhattan is an island in the Northeastern United States, which corresponds to maps depicting Gotham City. However, the 1990 Atlas of the DC Universe states that Gotham is located in New Jersey, across the Delaware Bay from Metropolis, which would place it on the southern coast of New Jersey.\n\nHistorically, \"Gotham\" has been a nickname for New York City originating on November 11, 1807 by Washington Irving in his Salmagundi Papers.  DC Comics publisher and former president Paul Levitz says that Gotham is \"New York from 14th Street down, the older buildings, more brick-and-mortar as opposed to steel-and-glass.\" New York Times journalist William Safire described Gotham City as \"New York below 14th Street, from SoHo to Greenwich Village, the Bowery, Little Italy, Chinatown, and the sinister areas around the base of the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges.\"\n\n'Batman: Shadow of the Bat,' Volume 1, Annual #1 (1993) establishes that Gotham City is in New Jersey. Sal E. Jordan's driver's license in the comic depicts his address is: 72 Faxcol Dr Gotham City, NJ 12345.\n\nRelationship with Metropolis\n\nGotham City is frequently depicted to be within driving distance of Metropolis, the home of Superman. Like Gotham, Metropolis' location has also varied over the years. The distance between Gotham and Metropolis has varied greatly over the years, with depictions of the two ranging from being hundreds of miles apart to Gotham and Metropolis being shown as twin cities on opposite sides of Delaware Bay, with Gotham City in New Jersey and Metropolis in Delaware.",

District Attorney Henry Wade briefed reporters at the press conference telling them that Lee Oswald was a member of the anti-Castro Free Cuba Committee. Ruby was one of several people there who spoke up to correct Wade, saying: \"Henry, that's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,\" a pro-Castro organization.    Ruby told the FBI, a month after his arrest for killing Oswald, that he had his loaded snub-nosed Colt Cobra .38 revolver in his right pocket during the press conference.   \n\nNovember 24: The killing of Oswald\n\nLater in the day, after driving into town with his two pet dogs and sending an emergency money order to one of his employees, Ruby walked to the nearby police headquarters, where he made his way to the basement via either the Main Street ramp  or a stairway accessible from an alleyway next to the Dallas Municipal Building.  At 11:21 am CST \u2014 while authorities were escorting Oswald through the police basement to an armored car that was to take him to the nearby county jail \u2014 Ruby stepped out from a crowd of reporters and fired his .38 revolver into Oswald's abdomen, fatally wounding him. Ruby was immediately subdued by agents and police as he reportedly yelled \"You killed the president, you rat!\" The shooting was broadcast live nationally, and millions of television viewers witnessed it. Author Norman Mailer, and others, have questioned why Ruby would have left his two beloved dogs in his car if he had planned on killing Oswald at police headquarters.",

    "evidence": "Hilary and Jackie is a 1998 British biographical film directed by Anand Tucker. The screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce is often claimed to have been based on the memoir A Genius in the Family (later republished under the title 'Hilary and Jackie') by Piers and Hilary du Pr\u00e9,  which chronicles the life and career of their late sister, cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9.\n\nIn fact it was not, as the book had not yet been written; an 'Inside Film' programme, handed out at early showings of the film quotes screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce as saying,\"Hilary was working on the book at the same time as I was working on the film ... it was at a very early stage when we were doing the script.\"  The film was instead based on conversations with Hilary and Piers; unlike the book it does not claim to be the true story, and contains some made-up incidents. This is important, as the film attracted controversy and criticism for allegedly distorting details in Jacqueline's life, although Hilary du Pr\u00e9 publicly defended her version of the story.  \n\nEmily Watson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and Rachel Griffiths was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film is divided into two sections, the first telling events from Hilary's point of view and the second from Jackie's. It opens with Hilary and Jackie as children being taught by their mother to dance and play musical instruments, the cello for Jackie and the flute for Hilary.

He eventually wrote propaganda for the British war effort in the First World War. Buchan was in 1927 elected Member of Parliament for the Combined Scottish Universities, but he spent most of his time on his writing career, notably writing The Thirty-Nine Steps and other adventure fiction. In 1935 he was appointed Governor General of Canada by King George V, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of Canada R. B. Bennett, to replace the Earl of Bessborough. He occupied the post until his death in 1940. Buchan proved to be enthusiastic about literacy, as well as the evolution of Canadian culture, and he received a state funeral in Canada before his ashes were returned to the United Kingdom.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nBuchan was the first child of John Buchan\u2014a Free Church of Scotland minister\u2014and Helen Jane Buchan.

    "question": "In what year was the first Tarzan novel published?",
    "answer": "1914",
    "evidence": "Tarzan (John Clayton, Viscount Greystoke) is a fictional character, an archetypal feral child raised in the African jungles by the Mangani great apes; he later experiences civilization only to largely reject it and return to the wild as a heroic adventurer. Created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan first appeared in the novel Tarzan of the Apes (magazine publication 1912, book publication 1914), and subsequently in twenty-five sequels, several authorized books by other authors, and innumerable works in other media, both authorized and unauthorized.\n\nCharacter biography\n\nChildhood years\n\nTarzan is the son of a British lord and lady who were marooned on the Atlantic coast of Africa by mutineers. When Tarzan was only an infant, his mother died, and his father was killed by Kerchak, leader of the ape tribe by whom Tarzan was adopted. From then onwards, Tarzan became a feral child. Tarzan's tribe of apes is known as the Mangani, Great Apes of a species unknown to science. Kala is his ape mother. Burroughs added stories occurring during Tarzan's adolescence in his sixth Tarzan book, Jungle Tales of Tarzan. Tarzan is his ape name; his real English name is  John Clayton, Viscount Greystoke (according to Burroughs in Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle; Earl of Greystoke in later, less canonical sources, notably the 1984 movie Greystoke). In fact, Burroughs's narrator in Tarzan of the Apes describes both Clayton and Greystoke as fictitious names \u2013 implying that, within the fictional world that Tarzan inhabits, he may have a different real name.\n\nAdult life\nTarzan is a series of twenty-four adventure novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, followed by several novels either co-written by Burroughs, or officially authorized by his estate.  There are also two works written by Burroughs especially for children that are not considered part of the main series.\n\nThe series is considered a classic of literature and is the author's best-known work. Tarzan has been called one of the best-known literary characters in the world. Written by Burroughs between 1912 and 1965, Tarzan has been adapted many times, complete or in part, for radio, television, stage, and cinema. (It has been adapted for the cinema more times than any book except Dracula).\n\nEven though the copyright on Tarzan of the Apes has expired in the United States, the name Tarzan is still protected as a trademark of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. Also, the work remains under copyright in some other countries where copyright terms are longer.\n\nThe twenty four main books\n\nTarzan of the Apes (1912)\n\nThe novel tells the story of John Clayton III. John and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton II, Lord and Lady Greystoke of England, are marooned in the western coastal jungles of equatorial Africa in 1888. In September of 1889 their son John Clayton III is born. At one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape Kerchak. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape Kala. \n\nClayton is named \"Tarzan\" (\"White Skin\" in the ape language) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage. \n\nAs a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, he discovers his true parents' cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books.

    "question": "What is the name of the mountain pass which lies between Pakistan and Afghanistan?",
    "answer": "Khyber pass",
    "evidence": "As well as offering relatively easy travel between valleys, passes also provide a route between two mountain tops with a minimum of descent. As a result, it is common for tracks to meet at a pass; this often makes them convenient routes even when travelling between a summit and the valley floor. Passes traditionally were places for trade routes, communications, cultural exchange, military expeditions etc. A typical example is the Brenner pass in the Alps.\n\nSome mountain passes above the tree line have problems with snow drift in the winter. This might be alleviated by building the road a few meters above the ground, which will make snow blow off the road.\n\nSynonyms\n\nThere are many words for pass in the English-speaking world. In the United States, pass is very common in the West, the word gap is common in the southern Appalachians, notch in parts of New England, and saddle in northern Idaho.  Scotland has the Gaelic term bealach (anglicised \"balloch\"), while Wales has the similar bwlch (both being British Celtic languages). In the Lake District of north-west England, the term hause is often used, although the term pass is also common\u2014one distinction is that a pass can refer to a route, as well as the highest part thereof, while a hause is simply that highest part, often flattened somewhat into a high-level plateau.\n\nAround the world\n\nThere are thousands of named passes around the world, some of which are well-known, such as the Great St. Bernard Pass at 2473 m in the Alps, the Khyber Pass at 1027 m between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the Khardung La at 5359 m in Jammu and Kashmir, India. The roads at Mana Pass at 5610 m and Marsimik La at 5582 m, on and near the China-India border respectively, appear to be world's two highest motorable passes.\n\nGallery\nTourism\n\nPakistan, with its diverse cultures, people and landscapes attracted 1.1 million foreign tourists annually in 2011 and 2012 contributing $351 million and $369 million to Pakistan's economy respectively.  A significant decline since the 1970s when the country received unprecedented amounts of foreign tourists due to to the popular Hippie trail. The trail attracted thousands of Europeans and American's in 1960s and 1970s who travelled via land through Turkey, Iran into India through Pakistan.  The main destinations of choice for these tourists were the Khyber Pass, Peshawar, Karachi, Lahore, Swat and Rawalpindi.  However, the trail declined after the Iranian Revolution and the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. \n\nThe country however continues to attract an estimated of half a million foreign tourists.  Pakistan's attraction range from the ruin of civilisation such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa and Taxila, to the Himalayan hill stations. Pakistan is home to several mountain peaks over 7000 m.  The north part of Pakistan has many old fortresses, ancient architecture and the Hunza and Chitral valley, home to small pre-Islamic Animist Kalasha community claiming descent from Alexander the Great. Pakistan's cultural capital, Lahore, contains many examples of Mughal architecture such as Badshahi Masjid, Shalimar Gardens, Tomb of Jahangir and the Lahore Fort.\nIn October 1772, Durrani died of a natural cause and was buried at a site now adjacent to the Shrine of the Cloak in Kandahar. He was succeeded by his son, Timur Shah, who transferred the capital of Afghanistan from Kandahar to Kabul in 1776. After Timur's death in 1793, the Durrani throne passed down to his son Zaman Shah, followed by Mahmud Shah, Shuja Shah and others. \n\nThe Afghan Empire was under threat in the early 19th century by the Persians in the west and the Sikh Empire in the east. Fateh Khan, leader of the Barakzai tribe, had installed 21 of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire. After his death, they rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves. During this turbulent period, Afghanistan had many temporary rulers until Dost Mohammad Khan declared himself emir in 1826.  The Punjab region was lost to Ranjit Singh, who invaded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in 1834 captured the city of Peshawar.  In 1837, during the Battle of Jamrud near the Khyber Pass, Akbar Khan and the Afghan army failed to capture the Jamrud fort from the Sikh Khalsa Army, but killed Sikh Commander Hari Singh Nalwa, thus ending the Afghan-Sikh Wars.

    "question": "Who was king of France at the time of the French Revolution?",
    "answer": "Louis XVI",
    "evidence": "Under Louis XIII, the energetic Cardinal Richelieu reinforced the centralization of the state, royal power and French dominance in Europe, foreshadowing the reign of Louis XIV. During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France, which was at that time at war with Spain. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal power in France.\n\nThe monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged. Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power. France became the most populous country in Europe and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.  France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Louis XIV also revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile.\n\nUnder Louis XV, Louis XIV's grandson, France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War, which ended in 1763. Its European territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions  as well as the debauchery of his court discredited the monarchy and arguably led to the French Revolution 15 years after his death.\nThe election system was complex and designed to insulate the government from grass roots democracy. The parliament consisted of two houses: the Conseil des Cinq-Cents (Council of the Five Hundred) with 500 representatives, and the Conseil des Anciens (Council of Elders) with 250 senators. Executive power went to five \"directors,\" named annually by the Conseil des Anciens from a list submitted by the Conseil des Cinq-Cents. Furthermore, the universal male suffrage of 1793 was replaced by limited suffrage based on property. The voters had only a limited choice because the electoral rules required two-thirds of the seats go to members of the old Convention, no matter how few popular votes they received. \n\nWith the establishment of the Directory, contemporary observers might have assumed that the Revolution was finished. Citizens of the war-weary nation wanted stability, peace, and an end to conditions that at times bordered on chaos. Those on the right who wished to restore the monarchy by putting Louis XVIII on the throne, and those on the left who would have renewed the Reign of Terror tried but failed to overthrow the Directory. The earlier atrocities had made confidence or goodwill between parties impossible. \n\nState finances were in total disarray; the government could only cover its expenses through the plunder and the tribute of foreign countries. If peace were made, the armies would return home and the directors would have to face the exasperation of the rank-and-file who had lost their livelihood, as well as the ambition of generals who could, in a moment, brush them aside. Barras and Rewbell were notoriously corrupt themselves and screened corruption in others. The patronage of the directors was ill-bestowed, and the general maladministration heightened their unpopularity.\nHouse of Bonaparte, First Empire (1804\u20131814)\n\nThe French First Republic lasted from 1792 to 1804, when its First Consul, Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, was declared Emperor of the French.\n\nCapetian Dynasty (1814\u20131815)\n\nFollowing the first defeat of Napoleon and his exile to Elba, the Bourbon monarchy was restored, with Louis XVI's younger brother Louis Stanislas being crowned as Louis XVIII.  Louis XVI's son had been considered by monarchists as Louis XVII but he was never crowned and never ruled in his own right before his own death; he is not usually counted among French monarchs, creating a gap in numbering on most traditional lists of French kings. Napoleon would briefly regain control of the country during his Hundred Days rule in 1815.  After his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the Bourbon Monarchy was re-established yet again, and would continue to rule France until the July Revolution of 1830 replaced it with a cadet branch, the House of Orleans.\n\nHouse of Bourbon, Bourbon Restoration (1814\u20131815)\n\nHouse of Bonaparte, First Empire (Hundred Days, 1815)\n\nCapetian Dynasty (1815\u20131848)\n\nHouse of Bourbon (1815\u20131830)\n\nHouse of Orl\u00e9ans, July Monarchy (1830\u20131848)\n\nThe Bourbon restoration came to an end with the July Revolution of 1830, which deposed Charles X and replaced him with Louis Philippe I, a distant cousin with more liberal politics.  The popular monarchy changed the styles and forms of the ancien regime, replacing it with more populist forms (i.e. replacing \"King of France\" with \"King of the French\"). Ultimately it was overthrown as well during the continent-wide Revolutions of 1848, to be replaced by the Second French Republic.\n\nHouse of Bonaparte, Second Empire (1852\u20131870)\n\nThe Second French Republic lasted from 1848 to 1852, when its president, Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, was declared Emperor of the French.",

    "evidence": "After the adoption of Christianity the country preserved many institutions from the pagan state of the Bulgars. \n\nCreation of the Slavic Writing System\n\nAlthough the Bulgarian Knyaz succeeded in securing an autonomous Church, its higher clergy and theological books were still Greek, which impeded the efforts to convert the populace to the new religion. Between 860 and 863 the Byzantine monks of Greek origin  Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius created the Glagolitic alphabet, the first Slavic alphabet by order of the Byzantine Emperor, who aimed to convert Great Moravia to Orthodox Christianity. However, these attempts failed and in 886 their disciples Clement of Ohrid, Naum of Preslav and Angelarius, who were banished from Great Moravia, reached Bulgaria and were warmly welcomed by Boris I. The Bulgarian Knyaz commissioned the creation of two theological academies to be headed by the disciples where the future Bulgarian clergy was to be instructed in the local vernacular. Clement was sent to Ohrid in Macedonia,  a southwestern province of the Bulgarian kingdom, where he taught 3,500 pupils between 886 and 893. Naum established the literary school in the capital Pliska, moved later to the new capital Preslav. During the Council of Preslav in 893, Bulgaria adopted the Glagolitic alphabet and Old Church Slavonic (Old Bulgarian) language as official language of the church and state, and expelled the Byzantine clergy. In the 890s the Cyrillic script was created at the Preslav Literary School by the order of Simeon the Great.Paul Cubberley (1996) \"The Slavic Alphabets\". In Daniels and Bright, eds. The World's Writing Systems. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-507993-0.\n\nThe Golden Age\nBulgarian was the first \"Slavic\" language attested in writing. As Slavic linguistic unity lasted into late antiquity, in the oldest manuscripts this language was initially referred to as \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u044a \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044f\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a, \"the Slavic language\". In the Middle Bulgarian period this name was gradually replaced by the name , the \"Bulgarian language\". In some cases, the name  was used not only with regard to the contemporary Middle Bulgarian language of the copyist but also to the period of Old Bulgarian. A most notable example of anachronism is the Service of St. Cyril from Skopje (\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439), a 13th-century Middle Bulgarian manuscript from northern Macedonia according to which St. Cyril preached with \"Bulgarian\" books among the Moravian Slavs. The first mention of the language as the \"Bulgarian language\" instead of the \"Slavonic language\" comes in the work of the Greek clergy of the Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid in the 11th century, for example in the Greek hagiography of Saint Clement of Ohrid by Theophylact of Ohrid (late 11th century).\nDemographics\n\nAs of 1 January 2016, the population of the European Union is about 510.1\u00a0million people. In 2013, 5,075,000 live births were registered and 4,999,200 deaths. The net migration to the EU was +653,100. In 2010, 47.3 million people who lived in the EU were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million), Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million). \n\nUrbanisation\n\nThe EU contains 16\u00a0cities with populations of over one million. Besides many large cities, the EU also includes several densely populated regions that have no single core but have emerged from the connection of several cities and now encompass large metropolitan areas. The largest are Rhine-Ruhr having approximately 11.5\u00a0million inhabitants (Cologne, Dortmund, D\u00fcsseldorf et al.), Randstad approx. 7\u00a0million (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht et al.), Frankfurt Rhine-Main approx. 5.8\u00a0million (Frankfurt, Wiesbaden et al.), the Flemish Diamond approx. 5.5\u00a0million (urban area in between Antwerp, Brussels, Leuven and Ghent), Upper Silesia approx. 5.3\u00a0million (Katowice, Ostrava) and \u00d8resund approx. 3.7\u00a0million (Copenhagen, Malm\u00f6). \n\nLanguages\n\nAmong the many languages and dialects used in the EU, it has 24 official and working languages: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish.

    "question": "What is the name of the cathedral in Red Square, Moscow?",
    "answer": "St. Basil's",
    "evidence": "Red Square () is a city square (plaza) in Moscow, Russia. It separates the Kremlin, the former royal citadel and currently the official residence of the President of Russia, from a historic merchant quarter known as Kitai-gorod. Red Square is often considered the central square of Moscow since Moscow's major streets, which connect to Russia's major highways, originate from the square.\n\nOrigin and name \n\nThe name Red Square neither originates from the pigment of the surrounding bricks (which, in fact, were whitewashed at certain periods) nor from the link between the colour red and communism. Rather, the name came about because the Russian word \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f (krasnaya), which means \"red,\" was applied to a small area between St. Basil's Cathedral, the Spassky Tower of the Kremlin, and the Lobnoe Mesto (it actually never was a place of execution), and Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich officially extended the name to the entire square, which had previously been called Pozhar, or \"burnt-out place\", in reference to the fact that several buildings had to be burned down to make place for the square. Several ancient Russian towns, such as Suzdal, Yelets, and Pereslavl-Zalessky, have their main square named Krasnaya ploshchad.\n\nHistory\n\nThe rich history of Red Square is reflected in many paintings by Vasily Surikov, Konstantin Yuon and others. The square was meant to serve as Moscow's main marketplace. It was also the site of various public ceremonies and proclamations, and occasionally a coronation for Russia's Tsars would take place. The square has been gradually built up since that point and has been used for official ceremonies by all Russian governments since it was established.\n\nBefore the 18th century\nThe Crimean Tatars attacked again in 1591, but this time were held back by new defense walls, built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named Fyodor Kon. In 1592, an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city, including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River. As an outermost line of defense, a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east, principally the Novodevichy Convent and Donskoy, Danilov, Simonov, Novospasskiy, and Andronikov monasteries, most of which now house museums. From its ramparts, the city became poetically known as Bielokamennaya, the \"White-Walled\". The limits of the city as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the Garden Ring.\n\nThree square gates existed on the eastern side of the Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as: Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Savior and St. Nicholas which hung over them). The last two were directly opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral.\n\nThe Russian famine of 1601\u201303 killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow.\nFrom 1610 through 1612, troops of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied Moscow, as its ruler Sigismund III tried to take the Russian throne. In 1612, the people of Nizhny Novgorod and other Russian cities conducted by prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin rose against the Polish occupants, besieged the Kremlin, and expelled them. In 1613, the Zemsky sobor elected Michael Romanov tsar, establishing the Romanov dynasty. The 17th century was rich in popular risings, such as the liberation of Moscow from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian invaders (1612), the Salt Riot (1648), the Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising of 1682.",

    "question": "Which crusade was led by Philip II Augustus of France and Richard I of England?",
    "answer": "Third crusade",
    "evidence": "The Third Crusade (1189\u20131192), also known as The Kings' Crusade, was an attempt by European leaders to reconquer the Holy Land from Saladin (\u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb). The campaign was largely successful, capturing the important cities of Acre and Jaffa, and reversing most of Saladin's conquests, but it failed to capture Jerusalem, the emotional and spiritual motivation of the Crusade.\n\nAfter the failure of the Second Crusade, the Zengid dynasty controlled a unified Syria and engaged in a conflict with the Fatimid rulers of Egypt. The Egyptian and Syrian forces were ultimately unified under Saladin, who employed them to reduce the Christian states and recapture Jerusalem in 1187. Spurred by religious zeal, King Henry II of England and King Philip II of France (known as Philip Augustus) ended their conflict with each other to lead a new crusade. The death of Henry in 1189, however, meant the English contingent came under the command of his successor, King Richard I of England (known as Richard the Lionheart, in French C\u0153ur de Lion). The elderly Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa also responded to the call to arms, leading a massive army across Anatolia, but he drowned in a river in Asia Minor on 10 June 1190 before reaching the Holy Land. His death caused tremendous grief among the German Crusaders, and most of his troops returned home.\n\nAfter the Crusaders had driven the Muslims from Acre, Philip in company with Frederick's successor, Leopold V, Duke of Austria (known as Leopold the Virtuous), left the Holy Land in August 1191. On 2 September 1192, Richard and Saladin finalized a treaty granting Muslim control over Jerusalem but allowing unarmed Christian pilgrims and merchants to visit the city. Richard departed the Holy Land on 2 October.  The successes of the Third Crusade allowed the Crusaders to maintain considerable states in Cyprus and on the Syrian coast. However, the failure to recapture Jerusalem would lead to the Fourth Crusade.\n\nBackground\nPhilip II, called Philip Augustus (; 21 August 1165 \u2013 14 July 1223) was a King of France from the House of Capet who reigned from 1180 to 1223. Philip's predecessors had been known as kings of the Franks, but from 1190 onward, Philip became the first French monarch to style himself king of France. The son of King Louis VII and his third wife, Ad\u00e8le of Champagne, he was originally nicknamed Dieudonn\u00e9 \"God-given\" because he was the first son of Louis VII, born late in his father's life.  Philip was given the nickname \"Augustus\" by the chronicler Rigord for having extended the Crown lands of France so remarkably.\n\nAfter a twelve-year struggle with the Plantagenet dynasty in the Anglo-French War of 1202\u201314, Philip broke up the large Angevin Empire presided over by the crown of England and defeated a coalition of his rivals (German, Flemish and English) at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. This victory would have a lasting impact on western European politics: the authority of the French king became unchallenged, while the English King John was forced by his barons to sign the Magna Carta and deal with a rebellion against him aided by Philip, the First Barons' War.\n\nThe military actions surrounding the Albigensian Crusade helped prepare the expansion of France southward. Philip did not participate directly in these actions, but he allowed his vassals and knights to help carry it out.\n\nPhilip transformed France from a small feudal state into the most prosperous and powerful country in Europe. He checked the power of the nobles and helped the towns to free themselves from seigniorial authority, granting privileges and liberties to the emergent bourgeoisie. He built a great wall around Paris (\"the Wall of Philip II Augustus\"), re-organized the French government and brought financial stability to his country.\n\nEarly years\nRichard I (8 September 1157 \u2013 6 April 1199) was King of England from 6 July 1189 until his death. He also ruled as Duke of Normandy (as Richard IV), Duke of Aquitaine, Duke of Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Poitiers, Count of Anjou, Count of Maine, Count of Nantes, and Overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was known as  or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior.  He was also known in Occitan as Oc e No (Yes and No), because of his reputation for terseness. \n\nBy the age of 16, Richard had taken command of his own army, putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father. Richard was a central Christian commander during the Third Crusade, leading the campaign after the departure of Philip II of France and scoring considerable victories against his Muslim counterpart, Saladin, although he did not retake Jerusalem from Saladin. \n\nRichard spoke both French and Occitan. He was born in England, where he spent his childhood; before becoming king, however, he lived for most of his adult life in the Duchy of Aquitaine in the southwest of France. Following his accession he spent very little time, perhaps as little as six months, in England; most of his life as king was spent on Crusade, in captivity, or in actively defending his lands in France. Rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler, he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies.  Nevertheless, he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects.  He remains one of the few kings of England remembered by his epithet, rather than regnal number, and is an enduring iconic figure both in England and in France. \n\nEarly life and accession in Aquitaine\n\nChildhood",

It is a small, densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean.designated Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba within ISO [http://www.iso.org/iso/newsletter_vi-9_fiji-myanmar_and_other_minor_corrections-incl_bulgaria.pdf ISO 3166-1]. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom and Germany.  The largest and most important cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam. Amsterdam is the country's capital,  while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament.  The port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe \u2013 as large as the next three largest combined \u2013 and was the world's largest port between 1962 and 2004.  The name Holland is also frequently used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.\nThe Secretary-General acts as the de facto spokesperson and leader of the UN. The position is defined in the UN Charter as the organization's \"chief administrative officer\".  Article 99 of the charter states that the Secretary-General can bring to the Security Council's attention \"any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security\", a phrase that Secretaries-General since Trygve Lie have interpreted as giving the position broad scope for action on the world stage. The office has evolved into a dual role of an administrator of the UN organization and a diplomat and mediator addressing disputes between member states and finding consensus to global issues.\n\nThe Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly, after being recommended by the Security Council, where the permanent members have veto power.  There are no specific criteria for the post, but over the years it has become accepted that the post shall be held for one or two terms of five years, that the post shall be appointed on the basis of geographical rotation, and that the Secretary-General shall not originate from one of the five permanent Security Council member states. The current Secretary-General is Ban Ki-moon, who replaced Kofi Annan in 2007 and was elected for a second term to conclude at the end of 2016. \n\nInternational Court of Justice\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ), located in The Hague, in the Netherlands, is the primary judicial organ of the UN. Established in 1945 by the UN Charter, the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges who serve 9-year terms and are appointed by the General Assembly; every sitting judge must be from a different nation.\nThe International Court of Justice (; commonly referred to as the World Court or ICJ) is the primary judicial branch of the United Nations (UN). Seated in the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands, the court settles legal disputes submitted to it by states and provides advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it by duly authorized international branches, agencies, and the UN General Assembly.\n\nActivities\n\nEstablished in 1945 by the UN Charter, the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The Statute of the International Court of Justice, similar to that of its predecessor, is the main constitutional document constituting and regulating the Court. \n\nThe Court's workload covers a wide range of judicial activity. After the court ruled that the United States's covert war against Nicaragua was in violation of international law (Nicaragua v. United States), the United States withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction in 1986 to accept the court's jurisdiction only on a case-by-case basis.  Chapter XIV of the United Nations Charter authorizes the UN Security Council to enforce Court rulings. However, such enforcement is subject to the veto power of the five permanent members of the Council, which the United States used in the Nicaragua case.\n\nComposition\n\nThe ICJ is composed of fifteen judges elected to nine-year terms by the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council from a list of people nominated by the national groups in the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The election process is set out in Articles 4\u201319 of the ICJ statute. Elections are staggered, with five judges elected every three years to ensure continuity within the court. Should a judge die in office, the practice has generally been to elect a judge in a special election to complete the term.",

The bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold dismissed the militia and the fleet.Walker Harold pp. 144\u2013150 Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald of Norway and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state.Walker Harold pp. 158\u2013165\n\nWilliam's preparations and landing\n\nWilliam assembled a large invasion fleet and an army gathered from Normandy and the rest of France, including large contingents from Brittany and Flanders. He spent almost nine months on his preparations, as he had to construct a fleet from nothing. According to some Norman chronicles, he also secured diplomatic support, although the accuracy of the reports has been a matter of historical debate. The most famous claim is that Pope Alexander II gave a papal banner as a token of support, which only appears in William of Poitiers's account, and not in more contemporary narratives.Huscroft Norman Conquest pp. 120\u2013122 In April 1066 Halley's Comet appeared in the sky, and was widely reported throughout Europe.

Harold reigned from 6 January 1066   until his death at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October, fighting the Norman invaders led by William the Conqueror during the Norman conquest of England. His death marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule over England.\n\nHarold was a powerful earl and member of a prominent Anglo-Saxon family with ties to King Cnut. Upon the death of Edward the Confessor in January 1066, the Witenagemot convened and chose Harold to succeed; he was crowned in Westminster Abbey. In late September he successfully repelled an invasion by rival claimant Harald Hardrada of Norway, before marching his army back south to meet William the Conqueror at Hastings some two weeks later.\n\nFamily background\nTostig and Hardrada's invasion \n\nHarold's brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September 1066 and defeated the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the Battle of Fulford near York. King Harold received word of their invasion and marched north, defeating the invaders and killing Tostig and Hardrada on 25 September at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.Huscroft Norman Conquest pp. 118\u2013119 The Norman fleet finally set sail two days later, landing in England at Pevensey Bay on 28 September. William then moved to Hastings, a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations. From there, he ravaged the interior and waited for Harold's return from the north, refusing to venture far from the sea, his line of communication with Normandy.\n\nBattle of Hastings \n\nAfter defeating Harald Hardrada and Tostig, Harold left much of his army in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion. He probably learned of William's landing while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London, and was there for about a week before marching to Hastings, so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south, averaging about 27 mi per day,Marren 1066 p. 93 for the distance of approximately 200 mi.Huscroft Norman Conquest p. 124 Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke.

    "answer": "Mao Zedong",
    "evidence": "The Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), a theatre of World War II, forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population; in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died.  An estimated 200,000 Chinese were massacred in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation.  During the war, China, along with the UK, the US and the Soviet Union, were referred to as \"trusteeship of the powerful\"  and were recognized as the Allied \"Big Four\" in the Declaration by United Nations.   Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four major Allies of World War II, and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war.   After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the Pescadores, was returned to Chinese control. China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war. In 1947, constitutional rule was established, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China. \n\nPeople's Republic of China (1949\u2013present)\n\nMajor combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with the Communist Party in control of most of mainland China, and the Kuomintang retreating offshore, reducing the ROC's territory to only Taiwan, Hainan, and their surrounding islands. On 1 October 1949, Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China.  In 1950, the People's Liberation Army succeeded in capturing Hainan from the ROC  and incorporating Tibet.  However, remaining Nationalist forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.\nA series of political, economic and military missteps led to the KMT's defeat and its retreat to Taiwan (formerly \"Formosa\") in 1949, where it established an authoritarian one-party state continuing under Generalissimo/President Chiang Kai-shek. This state considered itself to be the continuing sole legitimate ruler of all of China, referring to the communist government or \"regime\" as illegitimate, a so-called \"Peoples' Republic of China\" declared in Beijing (Peking) by Mao Tse Tung in 1949, as \"mainland China\", \"Communist China, or \"Red China\". Although supported for many years, even decades by many nations especially with the support of the United States who established a 1954 Mutual Defense treaty, as the decades passed, since political liberalization began in the late 1960s, the PRC was able after a constant yearly campaign in the United Nations to finally get approval in 1971, to take the seat for \"China\" in the General Assembly, and more importantly, be seated as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council.  After recovering from this shock of rejection by its former allies and liberalization in the late 1970s from the Nationalist authoritarian government and following the death of Chiang Kai-shek, the Republic of China has transformed itself into a multiparty, representative democracy on Taiwan and  given more representation to those native Taiwanese, whose ancestors predate the 1949 mainland evacuation.\n\nEarly republic (1912\u201316)\n\nFounding of the republic",

    "question": "Which wife of Henry VIII had already married twice before she became queen, and married for a fourth time after Henry's death?",
    "answer": "Catherine Parr",
    "evidence": "Marriage to Catherine Parr \n\nHenry married his last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543.  A reformer at heart, she argued with Henry over religion. Ultimately, Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood which had gained ground following the fall of Cromwell had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it.  Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters Mary and Elizabeth.  In 1543, an Act of Parliament put the daughters back in the line of succession after Edward, Prince of Wales. The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will. \n\nPhysical decline \n\nLate in life, Henry became obese, with a waist measurement of 54 in, and had to be moved about with the help of mechanical inventions. He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly suffered from gout. His obesity and other medical problems can be traced from the jousting accident in 1536, in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's mood swings, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament.\nThe wives of Henry VIII were the six queens consort wedded to Henry VIII, King of England between 1509 and 1547. After his first divorce he appealed to the pope, who denounced him. He then turned to the Predestine party who had no inclined belief over the subject and had divorce written into the laws of the people.\n\nThe six women who were married to King Henry VIII were, in chronological order:\n\n# Catherine of Aragon (divorced, died while detained under guard at Kimbolton Castle, mother of Mary I)\n# Anne Boleyn (executed, mother of Elizabeth I)\n# Jane Seymour (died days after giving birth to Edward VI, believed to be caused by birth complications)\n# Anne of Cleves (divorced, outlived the rest of the wives)\n# Catherine Howard (executed)\n# Catherine Parr (widowed)\n\nHenry's first marriage lasted nearly 24 years, while the remaining five totaled less than 10 years combined.\n\nA common mnemonic device to remember the fates of Henry's consorts is \"Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived\".

At the time, the laws relating to marriage were under the jurisdiction of canon law, and there was no divorce under canon law. Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn was also annulled before her death.

    "answer": "Switzerland",
    "evidence": "The House of Habsburg (;), or House of Austria,  was one of the most influential royal houses of Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced emperors and kings of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Kingdom of England (Jure uxoris King), Kingdom of France (Queen consort), Kingdom of Germany, Kingdom of Hungary, Empire of Russia, Kingdom of Croatia, Second Mexican Empire, Kingdom of Ireland (Jure uxoris King), Kingdom of Portugal, and Habsburg Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities. From the sixteenth century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried.\n\nThe House takes its name from Habsburg Castle, a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland by Count Radbot of Klettgau, who chose to name his fortress Habsburg. His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own, adding \"Count of Habsburg\" to his title. The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum through the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.\n\nBy 1276, Count Radbot's seventh generation descendant Rudolph of Habsburg had moved the family's power base from Habsburg Castle to the Duchy of Austria. Rudolph had become King of Germany in 1273, and the dynasty of the House of Habsburg was truly entrenched in 1276 when Rudolph became ruler of Austria, which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918.\n\nA series of dynastic marriages  enabled the family to vastly expand its domains to include Burgundy, Spain and its colonial empire, Bohemia, Hungary, and other territories. In the 16th century, the family separated into the senior Habsburg Spain and the junior Habsburg Monarchy branches, who settled their mutual claims in the O\u00f1ate treaty.\nAfter the death of his wife, Regina in 2010, Otto stopped appearing in public. He died at the age of 98 on Monday, 4 July 2011, at his home in P\u00f6cking, Germany. His spokeswoman reported that he died \"peacefully and without pain in his sleep\".\n\nOn 5 July, his body was laid in repose in the Church of St. Ulrich near his home in P\u00f6cking, Bavaria, and a massive 13-day period of mourning started in several countries formerly part of Austria-Hungary.  Otto's coffin was draped with the Habsburg flag decorated with the imperial\u2013royal coats of arms of Austria and Hungary in addition to the Habsburg family coat of arms.\n\nIn line with the Habsburg family tradition, Otto von Habsburg was buried in the family's crypt in Vienna, while his heart was buried in a monastery in Pannonhalma, Hungary.\n\nFamily",

(However the drawing of district boundary lines can be very contentious in this system.)\n\nIn an election for a legislative body, each voter in a given geographically-defined electoral district votes for one candidate from a list of candidates competing to represent that district. Under the plurality system, the winner of the election then becomes the representative of the entire electoral district, and serves with representatives of other electoral districts.\n\nIn an election for a single seat, such as president in a presidential system, the same style of ballot is used and the candidate who receives the largest number of votes represents the entire population.",

    "question": "Which builder of steam engines formed a successful partnership with Matthew Boulton?",
    "answer": "James Watt",
    "evidence": "Pumping engines \n\nThe first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump, developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery. It used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below, then it used steam pressure to raise it higher. Small engines were effective though larger models were problematic. They proved only to have a limited lift height and were prone to boiler explosions. It received some use in mines, pumping stations and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery. An attractive feature of the Savery engine was its low cost. Bento de Moura Portugal introduced an ingenious improvement of Savery's construction \"to render it capable of working itself\", as described by John Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions published in 1751.  It continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century. One engine was still known to be operating in 1820. \n\nPiston steam engines\n\nThe first commercially successful true engine, in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine, was the atmospheric engine, invented by Thomas Newcomen around 1712.  It was an improvement over Savery's steam pump, using a piston as proposed by Papin. Newcomen's engine was relatively inefficient, and in most cases was used for pumping water. It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder. It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible, and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable \"head\". Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel.\nMatthew Boulton  (; 3 September 1728 \u2013 17 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt.  In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills.  Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment.\n\nBorn in Birmingham, he was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31.  By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham.  At Soho, he adopted the latest techniques, branching into silver plate, ormolu and other decorative arts. He became associated with James Watt when Watt's business partner, John Roebuck, was unable to pay a debt to Boulton, who accepted Roebuck's share of Watt's patent as settlement. He then successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt's patent for an additional 17 years, enabling the firm to market Watt's steam engine. The firm installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad, initially in mines and then in factories.\n\nBoulton was a key member of the Lunar Society, a group of Birmingham-area men prominent in the arts, sciences, and theology.  Members included Watt, Erasmus Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood and Joseph Priestley.  The Society met each month near the full moon.  Members of the Society have been given credit for developing concepts and techniques in science, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport that laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution.\nCopying machine\n\nBefore 1780 there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings. The only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens.  Watt at first experimented with improving this method, but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome.  He instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet, moistened with a solvent, and pressed to the original. The second sheet had to be thin, so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light, thus reproducing the original exactly.  \n\nWatt started to develop the process in 1779, and made many experiments to formulate the ink, select the thin paper, to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper, and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer. All of these required much experimentation, but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later. Watt formed another partnership with Boulton (who provided financing) and James Keir (to manage the business) in a firm called James Watt and Co. The perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others, but this was carried out over the next few years. Boulton and Watt gave up their shares to their sons in 1794.  It became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century.\n\nChemical experiments",

    "question": "What raw material is used for making glass?",
    "answer": "Sand",
    "evidence": "Marketing\n\nGlass container manufacture in the developed world is a mature market business. World demand for flat glass was approximately 52 million tonnes in 2009.[http://www.zbindendesign.wordpress.com/category/education-3/ zbindendesign] The United States, Europe and China account for 75% of demand, with China's consumption having increased from 20% in the early 1990s to 50%. Glass container manufacture is also a geographical business; the product is heavy and large in volume, and the major raw materials (sand, soda ash and limestone) are generally readily available, therefore production facilities need to be located close to their markets. A typical glass furnace holds hundreds of tonnes of molten glass, and so it is simply not practical to shut it down every night, or in fact in any period short of a month. Factories therefore run 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This means that there is little opportunity to either increase or decrease production rates by more than a few percent. New furnaces and forming machines cost tens of millions of dollars and require at least 18 months of planning. Given this fact, and the fact that there are usually more products than machine lines means that products are sold from stock. The marketing/production challenge is therefore to be able to predict demand both in the short 4\u201312 week term and over the 24\u201348 month long term. Factories are generally sized to service the requirements of a city; in developed countries there is usually a factory per 1\u20132 million people. A typical factory will produce 1\u20133 million containers a day.\nDespite its positioning as a mature market product, glass does enjoy a high level of consumer acceptance and is perceived as a \u201cpremium\u201d quality packaging format.\n\nLifecycle impact\nSilicate glass\n\nIngredients\n\nSilica (the chemical compound SiO2) is a common fundamental constituent of glass. In nature, vitrification of quartz occurs when lightning strikes sand, forming hollow, branching rootlike structures called fulgurite.\n\nFused quartz is a glass made from chemically-pure SiO2 (silica). It has excellent thermal shock characteristics, being able to survive immersion in water while red hot.  However, its high melting-temperature (1723\u00a0\u00b0C) and viscosity make it difficult to work with.   Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, \"soda\"), which lowers the glass transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (calcium oxide [CaO], generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass.B. H. W. S. de Jong, \"Glass\"; in \"Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry\"; 5th edition, vol. A12, VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany, 1989, ISBN 978-3-527-20112-9, pp. 365\u2013432. Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.\n\nMost common glass contains other ingredients to change its properties. Lead glass or flint glass is more 'brilliant' because the increased refractive index causes noticeably more specular reflection and increased optical dispersion. Adding barium also increases the refractive index. Thorium oxide gives glass a high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses, but due to its radioactivity has been replaced by lanthanum oxide in modern eyeglasses. Iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb infrared energy, for example in heat absorbing filters for movie projectors, while cerium(IV) oxide can be used for glass that absorbs UV wavelengths.",

    "question": "What kind of an organism is a truffle?",
    "answer": "Fungus",
    "evidence": "In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic size and are thus classified as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\n\nAn organism  may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote. Prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains, the Bacteria and Archaea. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae, all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria). Fungi, animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes.\n\nEstimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million,  of which only about 1.2 million have been documented.  More than 99% of all species, amounting to over five billion species,  that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.   In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth. \n\nEtymology \n\nThe term \"organism\" (from Greek \u1f40\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, organismos, from \u1f44\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, organon, i.e. \"instrument, implement, tool, organ of sense or apprehension\") first appeared in the English language in 1703 and took on its current definition by 1834 (Oxford English Dictionary). It is directly related to the term \"organization\". There is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings.\nA truffle is the fruiting body of a subterranean Ascomycete fungus, predominantly one of the many species of the genus Tuber. Truffles are ectomycorrhizal fungi and are therefore usually found in close association with the roots of trees. Spore dispersal is accomplished through fungivores, animals that eat fungi.\n\nSome of the truffle species are highly prized as food. French gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin called truffles \"the diamond of the kitchen\".  Edible truffles are held in high esteem in Croatian, French, Georgian, Greek, Italian, Middle Eastern, and Spanish cooking, as well as in international .\n\nHistory \n\nAntiquity \n\nThe first mention of truffles appears in the inscriptions of the neo-Sumerians regarding their Amorite enemy's eating habits (Third Dynasty of Ur, 20th century BCE)  and later in writings of Theophrastus in the fourth century BCE. In classical times, their origins were a mystery that challenged many; Plutarch and others thought them to be the result of lightning, warmth and water in the soil, while Juvenal thought thunder and rain to be instrumental in their origin. Cicero deemed them children of the earth, while Dioscorides thought they were tuberous roots.\n\nItaly in the Classical period produced three kinds of truffles: the , the  and the . The Romans, however, only used the terfez (Terfezia bouderi), a fungus of similar appearance, which the Romans called truffles, and which is sometimes called \"desert truffle\". Terfez used in Rome came from Lesbos, Carthage, and especially Libya, where the coastal climate was less dry in ancient times. Their substance is pale, tinged with rose. Unlike truffles, terfez have no taste of their own. The Romans used the terfez as a carrier of flavour, because the terfez have the property to absorb surrounding flavours. Indeed, Ancient Roman cuisine used many spices and flavours, and terfez were perfect in that context.\n\nMiddle Ages",

    "question": "What is the name of the strong material found in plant cell walls?",
    "answer": "Cellulose",
    "evidence": "Pectin and hemicellulose are the dominant constituents of collenchyma cell walls of dicotyledon angiosperms, which may contain as little as 20% of cellulose in Petasites.PA Roelofsen (1959) 'The plant cell wall.' Handbuch fur Pflanzenanatomie. Band III. Gebr\u00fcder Borntraeger, Berlin Collenchyma cells are typically quite elongated, and may divide transversely to give a septate appearance. The role of this cell type is to support the plant in axes still growing in length, and to confer flexibility and tensile strength on tissues. The primary wall lacks lignin that would make it tough and rigid, so this cell type provides what could be called plastic support \u2013 support that can hold a young stem or petiole into the air, but in cells that can be stretched as the cells around them elongate. Stretchable support (without elastic snap-back) is a good way to describe what collenchyma does. Parts of the strings in celery are collenchyma.\n\n* Sclerenchyma cells \u2013 Sclerenchyma cells (from the Greek skleros, hard) are hard and tough cells with a function in mechanical support. They are of two broad types \u2013 sclereids or stone cells and fibres. The cells develop an extensive secondary cell wall that is laid down on the inside of the primary cell wall. The secondary wall is impregnated with lignin, making it hard and impermeable to water.  Thus, these cells cannot survive for long' as they cannot exchange sufficient material to maintain active metabolism. Sclerenchyma cells are typically dead at functional maturity, and the cytoplasm is missing, leaving an empty central cavity.\nComposition\n\nIn the primary (growing) plant cell wall, the major carbohydrates are cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The cellulose microfibrils are linked via hemicellulosic tethers to form the cellulose-hemicellulose network, which is embedded in the pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose  in the primary cell wall is xyloglucan. In grass cell walls, xyloglucan and pectin are reduced in abundance and partially replaced by glucuronarabinoxylan, another type of hemicellulose. Primary cell walls characteristically extend (grow) by a mechanism called acid growth, which involves turgor-driven movement of the strong cellulose microfibrils within the weaker hemicellulose/pectin matrix, catalyzed by expansin proteins. The outer part of the primary cell wall of the plant epidermis is usually impregnated with cutin and wax, forming a permeability barrier known as the plant cuticle.\n\nSecondary cell walls contain a wide range of additional compounds that modify their mechanical properties and permeability. The major polymers that make up wood (largely secondary cell walls) include:\n* cellulose, 35-50%\n* xylan, 20-35%, a type of hemicellulose\n* lignin, 10-25%,  a complex phenolic polymer that penetrates the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin components, driving out water and strengthening the wall.",

    "evidence": "A liquid, like a gas, displays the properties of a fluid. A liquid can flow, assume the shape of a container, and, if placed in a sealed container, will distribute applied pressure evenly to every surface in the container. If you place the liquid in a bag, you can squeeze it into any shape you want. Unlike a gas, a liquid may not always mix readily with another liquid, will not always fill every space in the container, forming its own surface, and will not compress significantly, except under extremely high pressures. These properties make a liquid suitable for applications such as hydraulics.\n\nLiquid particles are bound firmly but not rigidly. They are able to move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the increased vibrations of the molecules causes distances between the molecules to increase. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and the liquid changes to its gaseous state (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature is decreased, the distances between the molecules become smaller. When the liquid reaches its freezing point the molecules will usually lock into a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs).\n\nExamples\n\nOnly two elements are liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure: mercury and bromine. Four more elements have melting points slightly above room temperature: francium, caesium, gallium and rubidium.  Metal alloys that are liquid at room temperature include NaK, a sodium-potassium metal alloy, galinstan, a fusible alloy liquid, and some amalgams (alloys involving mercury).",

    "answer": "Arithmetic",
    "evidence": "Antiquity\n\nBefore the invention or discovery of the concept of \"nature\" (Ancient Greek phusis), by the Pre-Socratic philosophers, the same words tend to be used to describe the natural \"way\" in which a plant grows,  and the \"way\" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish \"nature\" and \"convention\".  Science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature, and the things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy\u00a0\u2014 the realm of the first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly speculators or theorists, particularly interested in astronomy. In contrast, trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology, Greek techn\u0113) was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans. \nA clear-cut distinction between formal (eon) and empirical science (doxa) was made by pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BCE). Although his work peri physeos is a poem, it may be viewed as an epistemological essay, an essay on method in natural science.

'Physis' may be identical to \u1f10\u1f78\u03bd.\nSubtraction is a mathematical operation that represents the operation of removing objects from a collection. It is signified by the minus sign (\u2212). For example, in the picture on the right, there are 5 \u2212 2 apples\u2014meaning 5 apples with 2 taken away, which is a total of 3 apples. Therefore, 5 \u2212 2 = 3. Besides counting fruits, subtraction can also represent combining other physical and abstract quantities using different kinds of objects including negative numbers, fractions, irrational numbers, vectors, decimals, functions, and matrices.\n\nSubtraction follows several important patterns. It is anticommutative, meaning that changing the order changes the sign of the answer. It is not associative, meaning that when one subtracts more than two numbers, the order in which subtraction is performed matters. Subtraction of 0 does not change a number. Subtraction also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as addition and multiplication. All of these rules can be proven, starting with the subtraction of integers and generalizing up through the real numbers and beyond. General binary operations that continue these patterns are studied in abstract algebra.\n\nPerforming subtraction is one of the simplest numerical tasks. Subtraction of very small numbers is accessible to young children. In primary education, students are taught to subtract numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems.\n\nNotation and terminology\n\nSubtraction is written using the minus sign \"\u2212\" between the terms; that is, in infix notation. The result is expressed with an equals sign. For example,\n2 - 1 = 1  (verbally, \"two minus one equals one\")\n4 - 2 = 2  (verbally, \"four minus two equals two\")\n6 - 3 = 3  (verbally, \"six minus three equals three\")\n4 - 6 = -2  (verbally, \"four minus six equals negative two\")\nBabylonians\n\nThe Babylonians used a sexagesimal positional number system, analogous to the modern day decimal system.  Thus, Babylonian multiplication was very similar to modern decimal multiplication.  Because of the relative difficulty of remembering 60 \u00d7 60 different products, Babylonian mathematicians employed multiplication tables.  These tables consisted of a list of the first twenty multiples of a certain principal number n: n, 2n, ..., 20n; followed by the multiples of 10n: 30n 40n, and 50n.  Then to compute any sexagesimal product, say 53n, one only needed to add 50n and 3n computed from the table.\n\nChinese\n\nIn the mathematical text Zhou Bi Suan Jing, dated prior to 300 BC, and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, multiplication calculations were written out in words, although the early Chinese mathematicians employed  Rod calculus  involving place value addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. These place value decimal arithmetic algorithms were introduced by Al Khwarizmi to  Arab countries in the early 9th century.\n\nModern methods\n\nThe modern method of multiplication based on the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system was first described by Brahmagupta.  Brahmagupta gave rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Henry Burchard Fine, then professor of Mathematics at Princeton University, wrote the following:\nThe Indians are the inventors not only of the positional decimal system itself, but of most of the processes involved in elementary reckoning with the system. Addition and subtraction they performed quite as they are performed nowadays; multiplication they effected in many ways, ours among them, but division they did cumbrously. \n\nGrid Method\n\nGrid method multiplication or the box method, is used in primary schools in England and Wales to help teach and understanding of how multiple digit multiplication works. An example of multiplying 34 by 13 would be to lay the numbers out in a grid like:\n\nand then add the entries.",

    "evidence": "Non-fundamental forces\n\nSome forces are consequences of the fundamental ones. In such situations, idealized models can be utilized to gain physical insight.\n\nNormal force\n\nThe normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.\n\nFriction\n\nFriction is a surface force that opposes relative motion. The frictional force is directly related to the normal force that acts to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: static friction and kinetic friction.\n\nThe static friction force (F_{\\mathrm{sf}}) will exactly oppose forces applied to an object parallel to a surface contact up to the limit specified by the coefficient of static friction (\\mu_{\\mathrm{sf}}) multiplied by the normal force (F_N). In other words, the magnitude of the static friction force satisfies the inequality:\n0 \\le F_{\\mathrm{sf}} \\le \\mu_{\\mathrm{sf}} F_\\mathrm{N}.\n\nThe kinetic friction force (F_{\\mathrm{kf}}) is independent of both the forces applied and the movement of the object. Thus, the magnitude of the force equals:\nF_{\\mathrm{kf}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{kf}} F_\\mathrm{N},\n\nwhere \\mu_{\\mathrm{kf}} is the coefficient of kinetic friction. For most surface interfaces, the coefficient of kinetic friction is less than the coefficient of static friction.\n\nTension",

    "question": "What type of seaweed grows up to 100 meters in length, and is farmed for its alginates?",
    "answer": "Kelp",
    "evidence": "In Asia, Gim (Korean food) (\uae40, Korea), nori (\u6d77\u82d4, Japan), zicai (\u7d2b\u83dc, China) are sheets of dried Porphyra used in soups, sushi wrap or onigiri also known as rice ball. Chondrus crispus (commonly known as 'Irish moss' or carrageenan moss) is another red alga used in producing food additives, along with Kappaphycus and gigartinoid seaweed. Porphyra is a red alga used in Wales to make laver. Laverbread, made from oats and the laver, is a popular dish there. In northern Belize, edible seaweed are mixed with milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla to make a common beverage affectionately called \"dulce\" (or \"sweet\").\n\nSeaweed are also harvested or cultivated for the extraction of alginate, agar and carrageenan, gelatinous substances collectively known as hydrocolloids or phycocolloids. Hydrocolloids have attained commercial significance as food additives.  The food industry exploits their gelling, water-retention, emulsifying and other physical properties. Agar is used in foods such as confectionery, meat and poultry products, desserts and beverages and moulded foods. Carrageenan is used in salad dressings and sauces, dietetic foods, and as a preservative in meat and fish products, dairy items and baked goods.\n\nHerbalism \n\nAlginates are commonly used in wound dressings, and production of dental moulds. In microbiology research, agar \u2014 a plant-based goo similar to gelatin and made from seaweed \u2014 is extensively used as culture medium. Carrageenans, alginates and agaroses (the latter are prepared from agar by purification), with other lesser-known macroalgal polysaccharides, have several important biological activities or applications in biomedicine.\n\nSeaweed extract is used in some diet pills.   Other seaweed pills exploit the same effect as gastric banding, expanding in the stomach to make the body feel more full.  \n\nFiltration\nSeaweeds can be classified into three broad groups based on pigmentation: brown, red and green. These broad groups are the Phaeophyceae, Rhodophyceae and Chlorophyceae, respectively. Brown seaweeds are usually large, and range from the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera that is often 20 m long, to thick, leather-like seaweeds from 2-4 m long, to smaller species 30\u201360\u00a0cm long. None of the usual seaweeds for alginate production are cultivated. They cannot be grown by vegetative means, but must go through a reproductive cycle involving an alternation of generations. This makes cultivated brown seaweeds too expensive when compared to the costs of harvesting and transporting wild seaweeds. The only exception is for Laminaria japonica, which is cultivated in China for food but the surplus material is diverted to the alginate industry in China.\n\nAlginates from different species of brown seaweed often have variations in their chemical structure, resulting in different physical properties. For example, some may yield an alginate that gives a strong gel, another a weaker gel; some may readily give a cream/white alginate, while others are difficult to gel, and are best used for technical applications where color does not matter. \n\nCommercial varieties of alginate are extracted from seaweed, including the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, Ascophyllum nodosum, and various types of Laminaria. It is also produced by two bacterial genera Pseudomonas and Azotobacter, which played a major role in the unravelling of its biosynthesis pathway. Bacterial alginates are useful for the production of micro- or nanostructures suitable for medical applications.\n\nThe chemical compound sodium alginate is the sodium salt of alginic acid. Its empirical formula is NaC6H7O6.  Sodium alginate is a gum, extracted from the cell walls of brown algae.\nAlgae (; singular alga) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related and are thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as Chlorella and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50\u00a0meters in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, Spirogyra and the stoneworts.\n\nThere is no generally accepted definition of algae. One definition is that algae \"have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells\".  Some authors exclude all prokaryotes  and thus do not consider cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) as algae. \n\nAlgae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor, and although their plastids seem to have a single origin, from cyanobacteria,  they were acquired in different ways. Green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. Diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga. \n\nAlgae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction.",

It is related to hemoglobin, which is the iron- and oxygen-binding protein in blood, specifically in the red blood cells. In humans, myoglobin is only found in the bloodstream after muscle injury. It is an abnormal finding, and can be diagnostically relevant when found in blood.\n (Google books link is the 2008 edition)\n\nMyoglobin is the primary oxygen-carrying pigment of muscle tissues.  High concentrations of myoglobin in muscle cells allow organisms to hold their breath for a longer period of time. Diving mammals such as whales and seals have muscles with particularly high abundance of myoglobin. Myoglobin is found in Type I muscle, Type II A and Type II B, but most texts consider myoglobin not to be found in smooth muscle.\n\nMyoglobin was the first protein to have its three-dimensional structure revealed by X-ray crystallography.  This achievement was reported in 1958 by John Kendrew and associates.  For this discovery, John Kendrew shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Max Perutz.  Despite being one of the most studied proteins in biology, its physiological function is not yet conclusively established: mice genetically engineered to lack myoglobin are viable, but showed a 30% reduction in volume of blood being pumped by the heart during a contraction.  They adapted to this deficiency through natural reactions to inadequate oxygen supply (hypoxia) and a widening of blood vessels (vasodilation).  In humans myoglobin is encoded by the MB gene. \n\nAs hemoglobin can take the forms of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), and methemoglobin (met-Hb), so can myoglobin take the forms of oxymyoglobin (MbO2), carboxymyoglobin (MbCO), and metmyoglobin (met-Mb).\n\nDifferences from hemoglobin",

    "question": "What is the most abundant substance in the plant kingdom, which no mammal produces the enzyme to digest?",
    "answer": "Cellulose",
    "evidence": "Behavior\n\nFeeding\n\nTo maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive \u2013 mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals \u2013 this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). Some mammals may be coprophagous, and consume feces, usually to consume more nutrients. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants on the other hand contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum.\nAfter some time (typically 1\u20132 hours in humans, 4\u20136 hours in dogs, 3\u20134 hours in house cats), the resulting thick liquid is called chyme.  When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine.  Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9.  Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon. Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation.\n\nDigestive system\n\nDigestive systems take many forms. There is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion. External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still rely on it.  In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, and some of the products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (gastrointestinal tract) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled. \n\nSome organisms, including nearly all spiders, simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals (e.g., enzymes) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent \"soup\". In others, once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism, digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure, through a tube, or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient.\n\nSecretion systems",

Behaviourism is a term that also describes the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour, usually referring to measured responses to stimuli or trained behavioural responses in a laboratory context, without a particular emphasis on evolutionary adaptivity.  Many naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig. The modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and by Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch, joint awardees of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with a strong relation to some other disciplines such as neuroanatomy, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Ethologists are typically interested in a behavioural process rather than in a particular animal group, and often study one type of behaviour, such as aggression, in a number of unrelated animals.\n\nEthology is a rapidly growing field. Since the dawn of the 21st century, many aspects of animal communication, emotions, culture, learning and sexuality that the scientific community long thought it understood have been re-examined, and new conclusions reached.

    "answer": "Squirrel",
    "evidence": "Auditory\n\nMany rodent species, particularly those that are diurnal and social, have a wide range of alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action.  Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information about the nature of the precise threat.  The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call. \n\nSocial rodents have a wider range of vocalizations than do solitary species. Fifteen different call-types have been recognized in adult Kataba mole rats and four in juveniles.  Similarly, the degu, another social, burrowing rodent, exhibits a wide array of communication methods and has an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising fifteen different categories of sound.  Ultrasonic calls play a part in social communication between dormice and are used when the individuals are out of sight of each other. \n\nHouse mice use both audible and ultrasonic calls in a variety of contexts. Audible vocalizations can often be heard during agonistic or aggressive encounters, whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups when they have fallen out of the nest.\nDrey construction materials and sizes differ according to squirrel species and region. Eastern gray squirrels, for example, tend to use the leaves, bark and twigs of deciduous trees such as beech, elm, and oak. Southern flying squirrels will often employ fungal rhizomorphs, deciduous leaves, bark and twigs in their nests, while northern flying squirrels often use shredded cedar bark (among other types of bark), lichens, mosses, leaves and twigs in their dreys. In the Pacific Northwest, the northern flying squirrel employs the common Bryoria lichen as the primary material.   A drey is almost always at least 20 ft above the ground, and flying squirrels build much higher.\n\nSometimes squirrels build their own dreys and sometimes they occupy a vacant drey that was previously constructed by another tree squirrel, often of a different species. Dreys must protect against the environment, and require constant upkeep to remain water and predator-resistant. Squirrels often build more than one in a season, as reserve nests, lest the primary drey be disturbed by predators or overrun by fleas or lice. Some dreys have been observed in use for more than a decade by multiple generations of squirrels, although the average drey may be used only a year or two before being abandoned. If used repeatedly, squirrels must constantly maintain their drey, replenishing twigs and leaves as necessary. Remnants of an abandoned nest may be visible for years.\n\nOccupation",

However, the leaf shape may be formed of lobes, but the gaps between lobes do not reach to the main vein. A compound leaf has a fully subdivided blade, each leaflet of the blade being separated along a main or secondary vein. Because each leaflet can appear to be a simple leaf, it is important to recognize where the petiole occurs to identify a compound leaf. Compound leaves are a characteristic of some families of higher plants, such as the Fabaceae.

They may be numerous, with some dolphins bearing over 100 teeth in their jaws.  On the other hand, the narwhals have a giant unicorn-like tusk, which is a tooth containing millions of sensory pathways and used for sensing during feeding, navigation and mating. It is the most neurologically complex tooth known.  Beaked whales are almost toothless, with only bizarre teeth found in males.  These teeth may be used for feeding but also for demonstrating aggression and showmanship.\n\nPrimates \n\nIn humans, there are usually 20 primary (\"baby\") teeth and 28 to 32 permanent teeth, the last four being third molars or \"wisdom teeth\", each of which may or may not grow in. Among primary teeth, 10 usually are found in the maxilla (upper jaw) and the other 10 in the mandible (lower jaw). Among permanent teeth, 16 are found in the maxilla and the other 16 in the mandible. Most of the teeth have distinguishing features.\n\nHorse \n\nAn adult horse has between 36 and 44 teeth. The enamel and dentin layers of horse teeth are intertwined.  All horses have 12 premolars, 12 molars, and 12 incisors.  Generally, all male equines also have four canine teeth (called tushes) between the molars and incisors.  However, few female horses (less than 28%) have canines, and those that do usually have only one or two, which many times are only partially erupted.  A few horses have one to four wolf teeth, which are vestigial premolars, with most of those having only one or two. They are equally common in male and female horses and much more likely to be on the upper jaw.  If present these can cause problems as they can interfere with the horse's bit contact. Therefore, wolf teeth are commonly removed.\nThe molars or molar teeth are large, flat teeth at the back of the mouth. They are more developed in mammals. They are used primarily to grind food during chewing. The name molar derives from Latin, molaris dens, meaning \"millstone tooth\", from \"mola\", millstone and dens, tooth. Molars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across mammal groups.\n\nHuman anatomy\n\nIn humans, the molar teeth have either four or five cusps. Adult humans have twelve molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. The third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. It is the last tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of twenty, although this varies from individual to individual. Ethnicity can also affect the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups.  In some cases, it may not even erupt at all.\n\nThe human mouth contains upper (maxillary) and lower (mandibular) molars.

The basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections called cusps and the valleys that separate them. The cusps contain both dentine and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenullations, are the result of different enamel thickness. Cusps are occasionally joined to form ridges and expanded to form crests. Cingula are often incomplete ridges that pass around the base of the crown.",

    "answer": "Insulin",
    "evidence": "Secretion is the movement of material from one point to another chemicals, or a secreted chemical substance from a cell or gland. In contrast to excretion, it is the removal of certain substances or waste products. The classical mechanism of cell secretion is via secretory portals at the cell plasma membrane called porosomes.  Porosomes are permanent cup-shaped lipoprotein structure at the cell plasma membrane, where secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra-vesicular contents from the cell.\n\nSecretion in bacterial species means the transport or translocation of effector molecules for example: proteins, enzymes or toxins (such as cholera toxin in pathogenic bacteria for example Vibrio cholerae) from across the interior (cytoplasm or cytosol) of a bacterial cell to its exterior. Secretion is a very important mechanism in bacterial functioning and operation in their natural surrounding environment for adaptation and survival.\n\nSecretion in eukaryotic cells\n\nMechanism\n\nEukaryotic cells, including human cells, have a highly evolved process of secretion. Proteins targeted for the outside are synthesized by ribosomes docked to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As they are synthesized, these proteins translocate into the ER lumen, where they are glycosylated and where molecular chaperones aid protein folding. Misfolded proteins are usually identified here and retrotranslocated by ER-associated degradation to the cytosol, where they are degraded by a proteasome. The vesicles containing the properly folded proteins then enter the Golgi apparatus.\n\nIn the Golgi apparatus, the glycosylation of the proteins is modified and further posttranslational modifications, including cleavage and functionalization, may occur. The proteins are then moved into secretory vesicles which travel along the cytoskeleton to the edge of the cell. More modification can occur in the secretory vesicles (for example insulin is cleaved from proinsulin in the secretory vesicles).\nDifferentiation of cells of the pancreas proceeds through two different pathways, corresponding to the dual endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas. In progenitor cells of the exocrine pancreas, important molecules that induce differentiation include follistatin, fibroblast growth factors, and activation of the Notch receptor system. Development of the exocrine acini progresses through three successive stages. These are the predifferentiated, protodifferentiated, and differentiated stages, which correspond to undetectable, low, and high levels of digestive enzyme activity, respectively.\n\nThe multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells have the capacity to differentiate into all the pancreatic cells: acinar cells, endocrine cells, and ductal cells. These progenitor cells are characterised by the co-expression of the transcription factors PDX1 and NKX6-1. Under the influence of neurogenin-3 and ISL1, but in the absence of notch receptor signaling, these cells differentiate to form two lines of committed endocrine precursor cells. The first line, under the direction of a Pax gene, forms \u03b1- and \u03b3- cells, which produce glucagon and pancreatic polypeptides, respectively. The second line, influenced by Pax-6, produces beta cells (\u03b2-) and delta cells (\u03b4-), which secrete insulin and somatostatin, respectively.\n\nInsulin and glucagon can be detected in the human fetal circulation by the fourth or fifth month of fetal development.\n\nFunction \n\nThe pancreas is involved in sugar control and metabolism within the body, and also in the secretion of substances which help digestion. Classically, these are divided into an \"endocrine\" role, relating to the secretion of insulin and other substances within pancreatic islets and helping control blood sugar levels and metabolism within the body, and an \"exocrine\" role, relating to the secretion of enzymes involved in digesting substances from outside of the body.\n\nSugar control and metabolism\nThe blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of a human or animal. The body naturally tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis.\n\nWith some exceptions,   glucose is the primary source of energy for the body's cells, and blood lipids (in the form of fats and oils) are primarily a compact energy store. Glucose is transported from the intestines or liver to body cells via the bloodstream, and is made available for cell absorption via the hormone insulin, produced by the body primarily in the pancreas.\n\nGlucose levels are usually lowest in the morning, before the first meal of the day (termed \"the fasting level\"), and rise after meals for an hour or two by a few millimolar. \nBlood sugar levels outside the normal range may be an indicator of a medical condition. A persistently high level is referred to as hyperglycemia; low levels are referred to as hypoglycemia. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia from any of several causes, and is the most prominent disease related to failure of blood sugar regulation. Intake of alcohol causes an initial surge in blood sugar, and later tends to cause levels to fall. Also, certain drugs can increase or decrease glucose levels. \n\nUnits\n\nThe international standard way of measuring blood glucose levels are in terms of a molar concentration, measured in mmol/L (millimoles per litre; or millimolar, abbreviated mM). In the United States, West-Germany and other countries mass concentration is measured in mg/dL (milligrams per decilitre). \n\nSince the molecular weight of glucose C6H12O6 is 180, for the measurement of glucose, the difference between the two scales is a factor of 18, so that 1\u00a0mmol/L of glucose is equivalent to 18\u00a0mg/dL.\n\u2014\u2014\n\nNormal values in humans",
    "generated": "Insulin and glucagon are secreted by the pancreas to regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin helps to lower blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells, while glucagon raises blood sugar levels by stimulating the release of glucose from storage sites in the liver."

    "question": "How many chambers has the heart?",
    "answer": "Four",
    "evidence": "Chambers\n\nThe heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, present in the atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also on the surface of the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible on the surface of the heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.\n\nThe cardiac skeleton is made of dense connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves.  The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.\n\nValves\n\nThe heart has four valves, which separate its chambers. The valves ensure blood flows in the correct direction through the heart and prevents backflow. Each valve consists of two to three cusps. The valves between the atria and ventricles connected to cartilaginous strings called chordae tendinae which in turn connect to muscles on the heart wall called papillary muscles.\nAir pollution\n\nParticulate matter has been studied for its short- and long-term exposure effects on cardiovascular disease. Currently, PM2.5 is the major focus, in which gradients are used to determine CVD risk. For every 10 \u03bcg/m3 of PM2.5 long-term exposure, there was an estimated 8\u201318% CVD mortality risk. Women had a higher relative risk (RR) (1.42) for PM2.5 induced coronary artery disease than men (0.90) did.  Overall, long-term PM exposure increased rate of atherosclerosis and inflammation. In regards to short-term exposure (2 hours), every 25 \u03bcg/m3 of PM2.5 resulted in a 48% increase of CVD mortality risk. In addition, after only 5 days of exposure, a rise in systolic (2.8 mmHg) and diastolic (2.7 mmHg) blood pressure occurred for every 10.5 \u03bcg/m3 of PM2.5.   Other research has implicated PM2.5 in irregular heart rhythm, reduced heart rate variability (decreased vagal tone), and most notably heart failure.   PM2.5 is also linked to carotid artery thickening and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction.\n\nCardiovascular risk assessment",

    "question": "What is the name of the large buttock and thigh muscle?",
    "answer": "Gluteus maximus",
    "evidence": "The buttocks (singular: buttock) are two rounded portions of the anatomy, located on the posterior of the pelvic region of apes (including humans), and many other bipeds or quadrupeds, and comprise a layer of fat superimposed on the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles.  Physiologically, the buttocks enable weight to be taken off the feet while sitting. In many cultures, they play a role in sexual attraction.  Many cultures have also used the buttocks as a primary target for corporal punishment,  as the buttocks' layer of subcutaneous fat offers protection against injury while still allowing for the infliction of pain. There are several connotations of buttocks in art, fashion, culture and humor, and the English language is replete with many popular synonyms. In humans the buttocks are located between the lower back and the perineum.\n\nAnatomy\n\nThe buttocks are formed by the masses of the gluteal muscles or \"glutes\" (the gluteus maximus muscle and the gluteus medius muscle) superimposed by a layer of fat. The superior aspect of the buttock ends at the iliac crest, and the lower aspect is outlined by the horizontal gluteal crease. The gluteus maximus has two insertion points:  superior portion of the linea aspera of the femur, and the superior portion of the iliotibial tractus. The masses of the gluteus maximus muscle are separated by an intermediate intergluteal cleft or \"crack\" in which the anus is situated.\n\nThe buttocks allow primates to sit upright without needing to rest their weight on their feet as four-legged animals do. Females of certain species of baboon have red buttocks that blush to attract males. In the case of humans, females tend to have proportionally wider and thicker buttocks due to higher subcutaneous fat and proportionally wider hips. In humans they also have a role in propelling the body in a forward motion and aiding bowel movement.\n\nSchmid and Seipel argue that the origin of muscle cells is a monophyletic trait that occurred concurrently with the development of the digestive and nervous systems of all animals and that this origin can be traced to a single metazoan ancestor in which muscle cells are present.  They argue that molecular and morphological similarities between the muscles cells in cnidaria and ctenophora are similar enough to those of bilaterians that there would be one ancestor in metazoans from which muscle cells derive. In this case, Schmid and Seipel argue that the last common ancestor of bilateria, ctenophora, and cnidaria was a triploblast or an organism with three germ layers and that diploblasty, meaning an organism with two germ layers, evolved secondarily due to their observation of the lack of mesoderm or muscle found in most cnidarians and ctenophores. By comparing the morphology of cnidarians and ctenophores to bilaterians, Schmid and Seipel were able to conclude that there were myoblast-like structures in the tentacles and gut of some species of cnidarians and in the tentacles of ctenophores. Since this is a structure unique to muscle cells, these scientists determined based on the data collected by their peers that this is a marker for striated muscles similar to that observed in bilaterians. The authors also remark that the muscle cells found in cnidarians and ctenophores are often contests due to the origin of these muscle cells being the ectoderm rather than the mesoderm or mesendoderm. The origin of true muscles cells is argued by others to be the endoderm portion of the mesoderm and the endoderm. However, Schmid and Seipel counter this skepticism about whether or not the muscle cells found in ctenophores and cnidarians are true muscle cells by considering that cnidarians develop through a medusa stage and polyp stage. They observe that in the hydrozoan medusa stage there is a layer of cells that separate from the distal side of the ectoderm to form the striated muscle cells in a way that seems similar to that of the mesoderm and call this third separated layer of cells the ectocodon. They also argue that not all muscle cells are derived from the mesendoderm in bilaterians with key examples being that in both the eye muscles of vertebrates and the muscles of spiralians these cells derive from the ectodermal mesoderm rather than the endodermal mesoderm. Furthermore, Schmid and Seipel argue that since myogenesis does occur in cnidarians with the help of molecular regulatory elements found in the specification of muscles cells in bilaterians that there is evidence for a single origin for striated muscle.",

    "evidence": "Animal \n\nVertebrate hormones fall into four main chemical classes:\n\n* Amino acid derived \u2013 Examples include melatonin and thyroxine.\n* Peptides, polypeptides and proteins. \u2013 Small peptide hormones include TRH and vasopressin. Peptides composed of scores or hundreds of amino acids are referred to as proteins. Examples of protein hormones include insulin and growth hormone. More complex protein hormones bear carbohydrate side-chains and are called glycoprotein hormones. Luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone are examples of glycoprotein hormones.\n* Eicosanoids \u2013 hormones derive from lipids such as arachidonic acid, lipoxins and prostaglandins.\n* Steroid \u2013 Examples of steroid hormones include the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone as well as the stress hormone cortisol.\n\nCompared with vertebrate, insects and crustaceans possess a number of structurally unusual hormones such as the juvenile hormone, a sesquiterpenoid. \n\nPlant \n\nPlant hormones include abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin, ethylene, and gibberellin.\n\nTherapeutic use \n\nMany hormones and their structural and functional analogs are used as medication. The most commonly prescribed hormones are estrogens and progestogens (as methods of hormonal contraception and as HRT),  thyroxine (as levothyroxine, for hypothyroidism) and steroids (for autoimmune diseases and several respiratory disorders). Insulin is used by many diabetics. Local preparations for use in otolaryngology often contain pharmacologic equivalents of adrenaline, while steroid and vitamin D creams are used extensively in dermatological practice.\nBy this time, the oocyte has completed meiosis I, yielding two cells: the larger secondary oocyte that contains all of the cytoplasmic material and a smaller, inactive first polar body. Meiosis II follows at once but will be arrested in the metaphase and will so remain until fertilization. The spindle apparatus of the second meiotic division appears at the time of ovulation. If no fertilization occurs, the oocyte will degenerate between 12 and 24 hours after ovulation.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1340563/ Ovarian ultrasonography highlights precision of symptoms of ovulation as markers of ovulation] Approximately 1-2% of ovulations release more than one oocyte. This tendency increases with maternal age. Fertilization of two different oocytes by two different spermatozoa results in fraternal twins.\n\nThe mucous membrane  of the uterus, termed the functionalis, has reached its maximum size, and so have the endometrial glands, although they are still non-secretory.\n\nLuteal  phase \n\nThe follicle proper has met  the end of its lifespan. Without the oocyte, the follicle folds inward on  itself, transforming into the corpus luteum (pl. corpora lutea), a  steroidogenic cluster of cells that produces estrogen and progesterone. These hormones induce the  endometrial glands to begin production of the proliferative endometrium and later  into secretory endometrium, the site of embryonic growth if  implantation occurs. The action of progesterone increases basal body temperature by one-quarter to one-half degree  Celsius (one-half  to one degree Fahrenheit).  The corpus luteum continues this paracrine  action for the remainder of the menstrual cycle, maintaining the  endometrium, before disintegrating into scar tissue during menses. \n\nClinical  presentation",

    "question": "What is the second most common gas in the atmosphere?",
    "answer": "Oxygen",
    "evidence": "Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.\n\nThe gaseous  state of matter is found between the liquid and plasma states,  the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases. Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases  which are gaining increasing attention.  High-density atomic gases super cooled to incredibly low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either a Bose gas or a Fermi gas. For a comprehensive listing of these exotic states of matter see list of states of matter.\n\nElemental gases \n\nThe only chemical elements which are stable multi atom homonuclear molecules at standard temperature and pressure (STP), are hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2); \nplus two halogens, fluorine (F2) and chlorine (Cl2). \nThese gases, when grouped together with the monatomic noble gases; which are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe) and radon (Rn) ; are called \"elemental gases\". Alternatively they are sometimes known as \"molecular gases\" to distinguish them from molecules that are also chemical compounds.\n\nEtymology\nTwo satellites of the outer planets possess significant atmospheres. Titan, a moon of Saturn, and Triton, a moon of Neptune, have atmospheres mainly of nitrogen.  When in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, Pluto has an atmosphere of nitrogen and methane similar to Triton's, but these gases are frozen when it is farther from the Sun.\n\nOther bodies within the Solar System have extremely thin atmospheres not in equilibrium. These include the Moon (sodium gas), Mercury (sodium gas), Europa (oxygen), Io (sulfur), and Enceladus (water vapor).\n\nThe first exoplanet whose atmospheric composition was determined is HD 209458b, a gas giant with a close orbit around a star in the constellation Pegasus. Its atmosphere is heated to temperatures over 1,000\u00a0K, and is steadily escaping into space. Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and sulfur have been detected in the planet's inflated atmosphere. \n\nStructure\n\nEarth\nThe study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology). Early pioneers in the field include L\u00e9on Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann. \n\nComposition\n\nThe three major constituents of air, and therefore of Earth's atmosphere, are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).  The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, among which are the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine (elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.\n\nStructure of the atmosphere \n\nPrincipal layers",

    "question": "Which radioactive substance sometimes occurs naturally in spring water?",
    "answer": "Radon",
    "evidence": "For a summary table showing the number of stable and radioactive nuclides in each category, see radionuclide. There exist twenty-nine chemical elements on Earth that are radioactive. They are those that contain thirty-four radionuclides that date before the time of formation of the solar system, and are known as primordial nuclides. Well-known examples are uranium and thorium, but also included are naturally occurring long-lived radioisotopes such as potassium-40. Another fifty or so shorter-lived radionuclides, such as radium and radon, found on Earth, are the products of decay chains that began with the primordial nuclides, and ongoing cosmogenic processes, such as the production of carbon-14 from nitrogen-14 by cosmic rays. Radionuclides may also be produced artificially in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, resulting in 650 of these with half-lives of over an hour, and several thousand more with even shorter half-lives. See this list of nuclides for a list of these, sorted by half life.\n\nHistory of discovery\n\nRadioactivity was discovered in 1896 by the French scientist Henri Becquerel, while working with phosphorescent materials.  These materials glow in the dark after exposure to light, and he suspected that the glow produced in cathode ray tubes by X-rays might be associated with phosphorescence. He wrapped a photographic plate in black paper and placed various phosphorescent salts on it. All results were negative until he used uranium salts. The uranium salts caused a blackening of the plate in spite of the plate being wrapped in black paper. These radiations were given the name \"Becquerel Rays\".",

    "question": "Which common mineral is used to make casts, moulds, blackboard chalk and plaster of Paris?",
    "answer": "Gypsum",
    "evidence": "Other orthosilicates include zircon, staurolite, and topaz. Zircon (ZrSiO4) is useful in geochronology as the Zr4+ can be substituted by U6+; furthermore, because of its very resistant structure, it is difficult to reset it as a chronometer. Staurolite is a common metamorphic intermediate-grade index mineral. It has a particularly complicated crystal structure that was only fully described in 1986. Topaz (Al2SiO4(F, OH)2, often found in granitic pegmatites associated with tourmaline, is a common gemstone mineral. \n\nNon-silicates\n\nNative elements\n\nNative elements are those that are not chemically bonded to other elements. This mineral group includes native metals, semi-metals, and non-metals, and various alloys and solid solutions. The metals are held together by metallic bonding, which confers distinctive physical properties such as their shiny metallic lustre, ductility and malleability, and electrical conductivity. Native elements are subdivided into groups by their structure or chemical attributes.\n\nThe gold group, with a cubic close-packed structure, includes metals such as gold, silver, and copper. The platinum group is similar in structure to the gold group. The iron-nickel group is characterized by several iron-nickel alloy species. Two examples are kamacite and taenite, which are found in iron meteorites; these species differ by the amount of Ni in the alloy; kamacite has less than 5\u20137% nickel and is a variety of native iron, whereas the nickel content of taenite ranges from 7\u201337%. Arsenic group minerals consist of semi-metals, which have only some metallic; for example, they lack the malleability of metals. Native carbon occurs in two allotropes, graphite and diamond; the latter forms at very high pressure in the mantle, which gives it a much stronger structure than graphite. \n\nSulfides\nWoodworking joints may be fitted by chalking one of the mating surfaces. A trial fit will leave a chalk mark on the high spots of the corresponding surface. Chalk transferring to cover the complete surface indicates a good fit. Builder's putty also mainly contains chalk as a filler in linseed oil.\n\nChalk may be used for its properties as a base. In agriculture, chalk is used for raising pH in soils with high acidity. The most common forms are CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) and CaO (calcium oxide). Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing. For example, toothpaste commonly contains small amounts of chalk, which serves as a mild abrasive. Polishing chalk is chalk prepared with a carefully controlled grain size, for very fine polishing of metals.  Chalk can also be used as fingerprint powder.\n\nPrevious uses \n\nThe traditional uses of chalk have in some cases been replaced by other substances, although the word \"chalk\" is often still applied to the usual replacements. Blackboard chalk is a substance used for drawing on rough surfaces, as it readily crumbles leaving particles that stick loosely to these surfaces. Although traditionally composed of natural chalk, modern blackboard chalk is generally made from the mineral gypsum (calcium sulfate), often supplied in sticks of compressed powder about 10\u00a0cm (4\u00a0in) long. Sidewalk chalk is similar to blackboard chalk, but it is shaped into larger sticks and often colored. It is used to draw on sidewalks, streets, and driveways. Tailor's chalk is traditionally a hard chalk used to make temporary markings on cloth, mainly by tailors. However, it is now usually made from talc (magnesium silicate).\nTypes\n\nGypsum plaster\n\nGypsum plaster, or plaster of Paris, is produced by heating gypsum to about 300\u00a0\u00b0F (150\u00a0\u00b0C):\nCaSO4\u00b72H2O + heat \u2192 CaSO4\u00b70.5H2O  +  1.5H2O (released as steam).\n\nWhen the dry plaster powder is mixed with water, it re-forms into gypsum.  The setting of unmodified plaster starts about 10 minutes after mixing and is complete in about 45 minutes; but not fully set for 72 hours.  If plaster or gypsum is heated above 266\u00a0\u00b0F (130\u00a0\u00b0C), anhydrite is formed, which will also re-form as gypsum if mixed with water. \n\nA large gypsum deposit at Montmartre in Paris led \"calcined gypsum\" (roasted gypsum or gypsum plaster) to be commonly known as \"plaster of Paris\". \n\nPlasterers often use gypsum to simulate the appearance of surfaces of wood, stone, or metal, on movie and theatrical sets for example. Nowadays, theatrical plasterers often use expanded polystyrene, although the job title remains unchanged.\n\nPlaster of Paris can be used to impregnate gauze bandages to make a sculpting material called modroc. It is used similarly to clay, as it is easily shaped when wet, yet sets into a resilient and lightweight structure. This is the material that was (and sometimes still is) used to make classic plaster orthopedic casts to protect limbs with broken bones, the artistic use having been partly inspired by the medical use (see orthopedic cast). Set modroc is an early example of a composite material. The hydration of plaster of Paris relies on the reaction of water with the dehydrated or partially hydrated calcium sulfate present in the plaster.\n\nLime plaster\n\nLime plaster is a mixture of calcium hydroxide and sand (or other inert fillers). Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the plaster to set by transforming the calcium hydroxide into calcium carbonate (limestone). Whitewash is based on the same chemistry.",

    "evidence": "Physical characteristics \n\nProteus is the second largest moon of Neptune. It is about 420 kilometres in diameter, larger than Nereid, the second to be discovered. It was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes because it is so close to Neptune that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight. The surface of Proteus is dark\u2014its geometrical albedo is about 10%. The color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green. In the near-infrared around 2\u00a0\u03bcm Proteus's surface becomes less reflective, pointing to a possible presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or cyanides. These compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner Neptunian moons. Although Proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice, it has not been detected spectroscopically on the surface.\n\nThe shape of Proteus is close to a sphere with a radius of about 210\u00a0km, although deviations from the spherical shape are large\u2014up to 20\u00a0km; scientists believe it is about as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a perfect spherical shape by its own gravity. Saturn's moon Mimas has an ellipsoidal shape despite being slightly less massive than Proteus, perhaps due to the higher temperature near Saturn or tidal heating. Proteus is slightly elongated in the direction of Neptune, although its overall shape is closer to an irregular polyhedron than to a triaxial ellipsoid. The surface of Proteus shows several flat or slightly concave facets measuring from 150 to 200\u00a0km in diameter. They are probably degraded impact craters.\nNereid is the third-largest moon of Neptune. It has a highly eccentric orbit. It was the second moon of Neptune to be discovered, by Gerard Kuiper in 1949.\n\nDiscovery and naming \n\nNereid was discovered on 1 May 1949 by Gerard P. Kuiper on photographic plates taken with the 82-inch telescope at the McDonald Observatory. He proposed the name in the report of his discovery. It is named after the Nereids, sea-nymphs of Greek mythology and attendants of the god Neptune. It was the second and last moon of Neptune to be discovered before the arrival of Voyager 2 (not counting a single observation of an occultation by Larissa in 1981).\n\nOrbit and rotation \n\nNereid orbits Neptune in the prograde direction at an average distance of 5513400 km, but its high eccentricity of 0.7507 takes it as close as 1372000 km and as far as 9655000 km.\n\nThe unusual orbit suggests that it may be either a captured asteroid or Kuiper belt object, or that it was an inner moon in the past and was perturbed during the capture of Neptune's largest moon Triton.\n\nIn 1991, a rotation period of Nereid of about 13.6\u00a0hours was determined by an analysis of its light curve. In 2003, another rotation period of about  was measured. However, this determination was later disputed. Other researchers have so far failed to detect any periodic modulation in Nereid's light curve.\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nNereid is Neptune's third-largest satellite and has an average radius of about 170 km. It is rather large for an irregular satellite. The shape of Nereid is not known.\nAsteroid satellites\n\nThe discovery of 243 Ida's natural satellite Dactyl in the early 1990s confirmed that some asteroids have natural satellites; indeed, 87 Sylvia has two. Some, such as 90 Antiope, are double asteroids with two comparably sized components.\n\nShape \n\nNeptune's moon Proteus is the largest irregularly shaped natural satellite. All other known natural satellites that are at least the size of Uranus's Miranda have lapsed into rounded ellipsoids under hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e. are \"round/rounded satellites\". The larger natural satellites, being tidally locked, tend toward ovoid (egg-like) shapes: squat at their poles and with longer equatorial axes in the direction of their primaries (their planets) than in the direction of their motion. Saturn's moon Mimas, for example, has a major axis 9% greater than its polar axis and 5% greater than its other equatorial axis.  Methone, another of Saturn's moons, is only around 3\u00a0km in diameter and visibly egg-shaped. The effect is smaller on the largest natural satellites, where their own gravity is greater relative to the effects of tidal distortion, especially those that orbit less massive planets or, as in the case of the Moon, at greater distances.\n\nGeological activity",

The galactic centre is in the middle of the view, with galactic north up.\n\nStructure\n\nThe Milky Way consists of a bar-shaped core region surrounded by a disk of gas, dust and stars. The gas, dust and stars are organized in roughly logarithmic spiral arm structures (see Spiral arms below). The mass distribution within the Milky Way closely resembles the type Sbc in the Hubble classification, which represents spiral galaxies with relatively loosely wound arms. Astronomers first began to suspect that the Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, rather than an ordinary spiral galaxy, in the 1990s. Their suspicions were confirmed by the Spitzer Space Telescope observations in 2005 that showed the Milky Way's central bar to be larger than previously thought.\n\nGalactic quadrants\n\nA galactic quadrant, or quadrant of the Milky Way, refers to one of four circular sectors in the division of the Milky Way. In actual astronomical practice, the delineation of the galactic quadrants is based upon the galactic coordinate system, which places the Sun as the origin of the mapping system. \n\nQuadrants are described using ordinals\u2014for example, \"1st galactic quadrant\", \"second galactic quadrant\", or \"third quadrant of the Milky Way\".

    "evidence": "Aristotelian physics began facing criticism in Medieval science, first by John Philoponus in the 6th century.\n\nThe shortcomings of Aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of Galileo Galilei, who was influenced by the late Medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus. Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century. He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force, for example friction. \n\nNewtonian mechanics\n\nSir Isaac Newton sought to describe the motion of all objects using the concepts of inertia and force, and in doing so he found that they obey certain conservation laws. In 1687, Newton went on to publish his thesis Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica.  In this work Newton set out three laws of motion that to this day are the way forces are described in physics.\n\nFirst law",

    "evidence": "Mainstream acceptance of LGBT people\n\nWhile Phil Donahue has been credited with pioneering the tabloid talk show genre, Winfrey's warmth, intimacy and personal confession popularized and changed it.  Her success at popularizing of the tabloid talk show genre had opened up a thriving industry that has included Ricki Lake, The Jenny Jones Show, and The Jerry Springer Show. Sociologists such as Vicki Abt criticized tabloid talk shows for redefining social norms. In her book Coming After Oprah: Cultural Fallout in the Age of the TV talk show, Abt warned that the media revolution that followed Winfrey's success was blurring the lines between \"normal\" and \"deviant\" behavior. In the book Freaks Talk Back, Yale sociology professor Joshua Gamson credits the tabloid talk show genre with providing much needed high impact media visibility for gay, bisexual, transsexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and doing more to make them mainstream and socially acceptable than any other development of the 20th century. In the book's editorial review Michael Bronski wrote, \"In the recent past, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered people had almost no presence on television. With the invention and propagation of tabloid talk shows such as Jerry Springer, Jenny Jones, Oprah, and Geraldo, people outside the sexual mainstream now appear in living rooms across America almost every day of the week.\"  Gamson credits the tabloid talk show with making alternative sexual orientations and identities more acceptable in mainstream society. Examples include a Time magazine article describing early 21st-century gays coming out of the closet younger and younger and gay suicide rates plummeting. Gamson also believes that tabloid talk shows caused gays to be embraced on more traditional forms of media.

    "question": "What colour is the cross on the national flag of Switzerland?",
    "answer": "White",
    "evidence": "Germany\n\nUnits of the Bundeswehr have only a single Colour. The Truppenfahne is a square version of the national flag with the Bundesadler (national shield) overall in the centre. The flag is surrounded by a black, red, and gold lacework border and edged on three sides by gold fringe. The finial is a gilt bronze openwork spearhead surrounding a black and silver Iron Cross. Below the finial, a streamer is attached with the unit badge at the top and its designation embroidered in gold at the end. These streamers are red for army (Heer) units, blue for the navy (Marine), and white for the air force (Luftwaffe). The streamer is the same length as the hoist of the flag. \n\nGreece\n\nTraditionally, Army infantry and tank/cavalry regiments have a single colour or war flag (). This is blue, with a white cross and features St George and the Dragon in the centre.  The flag has no distinguishing features for individual regiments, although battle honours are sometimes added to the flag; the regiment's identity is inscribed on the flagstaff. The pattern has been in use since the 1830s, with no changes between the periods of monarchy or republic. The Hellenic Army Academy has also been awarded a war flag, its cadets having participated in the Battle of Crete in 1941. Similar flags exist also for the Air Force, featuring the archangel Michael. Recently war flags were assigned to the Army NCO Academy and the Police Academy.\n\nUnlike Army, Police and Air Force, the Hellenic Navy uses the Flag of Greece as both the naval ensign and national colour.\n\nHoly See\n\nThe flag of the Swiss Guard, the army of the Vatican City, consists of four quarters. The Coat of Arms of the current pope is in the first quarter, while the arms of Pope Julius II are in the fourth quarter. In the second and third quarters are horizontal stripes of red, yellow and blue, the colours of the unit's uniforms.\nMost countries of Europe adopted a national flag in the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, often based on older (medieval) war flags. The specifications of the flag of Denmark were codified in 1748, based on a 14th-century design.  The flag of Switzerland was introduced in 1889, also based on medieval war flags. The Netherlands introduced two national flags in 1813 (either an orange-white-blue or a red-white-blue tricolour; the final decision in favour of red was made in 1937).\n\nThe Ottoman flag (now the flag of Turkey) was adopted in 1844. Other non-European powers followed the trend in the late 19th century, the flag of Japan being introduced in 1870, that of Qing China  in 1890. \nAlso in the 19th century, most countries of South America introduced a flag as they became independent (Peru in 1820, Bolivia in 1851, Colombia in 1860, Brazil in 1822, etc.)\n\nProcess of adoption\n\nThe national flag is often, but not always, mentioned or described in a country's constitution, but its detailed description may be delegated to a flag law passed by the legislative, or even   secondary legislation or in monarchies a decree.\n\nThus, the national flag is mentioned briefly in the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany of 1949 \"the federal flag is black-red-gold\" (art. 22.2 Die Bundesflagge ist schwarz-rot-gold), but its proportions were regulated in a document passed by the government in the following year. The Flag of the United States is not defined in the constitution but rather in a separate Flag Resolution passed in 1777.\nThe flag of Switzerland consists of a red flag with a white cross (a bold, equilateral cross) in the centre. It is one of only two square sovereign-state flags, the other being the flag of Vatican City.  (The civil and state ensign, used by Swiss ships and boats, has the more common proportions of 3:2.) \n\nOnly the dimensions of the cross are formally established since 1889: \"The coat of arms of the federation is, within a red field, an upright white cross, whose [four] arms of equal length are one and a sixth times as long as they are wide.\"  The size of the cross in relation to the field is not formally established except on the naval ensign, for which the ratio of the size of the cross to the height is 5:8, and to the length is 5:12.  A ratio of 2:3 or 7:10 to the span of the flag is usual.\n\nUse of the white cross as a military ensign (attached to the cantonal flags in the form of strips of linen) has been used in the Old Swiss Confederacy since the 14th century, but the modern design of a white cross suspended in a square red field was introduced only during the Napoleonic period, first used in 1800 during the Hundred Days by general Niklaus Franz von Bachmann, and was introduced as official national flag in 1889.\n\nHistory\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nThe ultimate origin of the white cross is attributed by three competing legends: To the Theban Legion, to the Reichssturmfahne (Imperial War Banner) attested from the 12th century, and to the Arma Christi that were especially venerated in the three forest cantons, and which they were allegedly allowed to display on the formerly uniformly red battle flag from 1289 by king Rudolph I of Habsburg at the occasion of a campaign to Besan\u00e7on.",

East Germany and its FDJ youth organization were worried they were losing an entire generation. They hoped that by letting Springsteen in, they could improve their sentiment among East Germans.

    "question": "What is the minimum number of darts a person needs to throw to complete a leg from 501?",
    "answer": "9",
    "evidence": "A throw that reduces a player's score below zero, to exactly one, or to zero but not ending with a double is known as \"going bust\", with the player's score being reset to the value prior to starting the turn, and the remainder of the turn being forfeited.\n\nIn some variants (called a \"northern bust\" in London) only the dart that causes the bust is not counted. That is felt by some to be a purer version of the game, as under the normal rules, as explained above, a player left with a difficult finish, e.g. 5 and one dart remaining will often deliberately \"bust\" it in order to get back to the easier finish that they had at the start of their go. For example, a player with 20 at the start of their go could miss the double 10 and get a single, miss the double 5 and get a single, leaving them 5 and only one dart remaining. Their best option is to deliberately bust it to get back onto double 10. Under the \"northern bust\" they would remain on 5.\n\nA darts match is played over a fixed number of games, known as legs. A match may be divided into sets, with each set being contested as over a fixed number of legs.\n\nAlthough playing straight down from 501 is standard in darts, sometimes a double must be hit to begin scoring, known as \"doubling in\", with all darts thrown before hitting a double not being counted. The PDC's World Grand Prix uses this format.\n\nThe minimum number of thrown darts required to complete a leg of 501 is nine. The most common nine dart finish consists of two 180 maximums followed by a 141 checkout (T20-T19-D12), but there are many other possible ways of achieving the feat. Three 167s (T20-T19-Bull) is considered a pure or perfect nine dart finish by some players.\n\nOther games and variants\n\nThere are a number of regional variations on the standard rules and scoring systems.\n\nRound the Clock\nArguably the most difficult nine dart finish would be 180 (3xT20), 171 (3xT19), and 150 (3xBULL) \u2013 owing to the difficulty of getting all three darts in the bullseye: it is the smallest double on the board.\n\nA nine dart finish is also attainable in games which require a double to commence scoring. In such games, throwing for double 20 first can lead to a maximum score of 160 with the first throw, leaving the thrower commonly requiring 180 then 161 (T20,T17,BULL) in their remaining six darts, though other outcomes are possible. It is worth noting that in these games, only throwing for double 20, double 17, or bullseye to start the leg can result in a nine dart finish.\n\nThe total number of different ways of achieving 501 with 9 darts is 3,944,  of which 2,296 finish with the BULL, 672 end on D20, 792 on D18, 56 end with D17, 120 finish on D15, and 8 end with D12.\n\nFirst televised nine-darter\n\nThe first televised nine dart finish was achieved at the MFI World Matchplay on 13 October 1984 by John Lowe,  who used the second method (with the T17 first, then T18, D18) above as his outshot after scoring two maximum 180s. For this he received a prize of \u00a3102,000, and he went on to win the whole event. This nine dart finish was not broadcast live, nor was Paul Lim's nine dart finish at the 1990 Embassy World Championship. The first ever live broadcast nine dart finish was performed by Shaun Greatbatch against Steve Coote in the Final of the Dutch Open on 3 February 2002, while Phil Taylor achieved the first live nine-darter broadcast on British television during the 2002 World Matchplay.\n\nWorld Championship nine-darters\n\nThe first player to manage the outshot in the World Championship was Paul Lim on 9 January 1990 against Jack McKenna.  He favoured the first method of those listed above for his outshot.  Lim won a \u00a352,000 bonus for the feat, which was more than the eventual tournament winner Phil Taylor who received \u00a324,000 for becoming World Champion.",

    "question": "What type of acid is extracted from the juice of lemons, oranges, limes, and grapefruit?",
    "answer": "Citric acid",
    "evidence": "An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron (proton or hydrogen ion H+), or, alternatively, capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair (a Lewis acid). \n\nThe first category of acids is the proton donors or Br\u00f8nsted acids. In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids. Br\u00f8nsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents. A Br\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+. \n\nAqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid.  Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste, can turn blue litmus red, and react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts. The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/ac\u0113re meaning sour.  An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid' (as in 'dissolved in acid'), while the strict definition refers only to the solute. A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic.\n\nCommon aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and citric acid (found in citrus fruits). As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid.\nThe 'Ponderosa' is more cold-sensitive than true lemons; the fruit are thick-skinned and very large. It is likely a citron-lemon hybrid.\n\nThe 'Yen Ben' is an Australasian cultivar. \n\nCulinary uses\n\nLemon juice, rind, and zest are used in a wide variety of foods and drinks. Lemon juice is used to make lemonade, soft drinks, and cocktails. It is used in marinades for fish, where its acid neutralizes amines in fish by converting them into nonvolatile ammonium salts, and meat, where the acid partially hydrolyzes tough collagen fibers, tenderizing the meat, but the low pH denatures the proteins, causing them to dry out when cooked. Lemon juice is frequently used in the United Kingdom to add to pancakes, especially on Shrove Tuesday.\n\nLemon juice is also used as a short-term preservative on certain foods that tend to oxidize and turn brown after being sliced (enzymatic browning), such as apples, bananas, and avocados, where its acid denatures the enzymes.\n\nLemon juice and rind are used to make marmalade, lemon curd and lemon liqueur. Lemon slices and lemon rind are used as a garnish for food and drinks. Lemon zest, the grated outer rind of the fruit, is used to add flavor to baked goods, puddings, rice, and other dishes.\n\nThe leaves of the lemon tree are used to make a tea and for preparing cooked meats and seafoods.\n\nOther uses\n\nIndustrial\n\nLemons were the primary commercial source of citric acid before the development of fermentation-based processes. \n\nAs a cleaning agent\nGrade numbers are determined by the amount of unsightly blemishes on the skin and firmness of the fruit that do not affect consumer safety. The USDA separates blemishes into three categories:\n# General blemishes: ammoniation, buckskin, caked melanose, creasing, decay, scab, split navels, sprayburn, undeveloped segments, unhealed segments, and wormy fruit\n# Injuries to fruit: bruises, green spots, oil spots, rough, wide, or protruding navels, scale, scars, skin breakdown, and thorn scratches\n# Damage caused by dirt or other foreign material, disease, dryness, or mushy condition, hail, insects, riciness or woodiness, and sunburn.\n\nThe USDA uses a separate grading system for oranges used for juice because appearance and texture are irrelevant in this case. There are only two grades: US Grade AA Juice and US Grade A Juice, which are given to the oranges before processing. Juice grades are determined by three factors:\n# The juiciness of the orange\n# The amount of solids in the juice (at least 10% solids are required for the AA grade)\n# The proportion of anhydric citric acid in fruit solids\n\nHistory \n\nThe orange is unknown in the wild state; it is assumed to have originated in southern China, northeastern India, and perhaps southeastern Asia, and that they were first cultivated in China around 2500 BC. \n\nIn Europe, citrus fruits\u2014among them the bitter orange, introduced to Italy by the crusaders in the 11th century\u2014were grown widely in the south for medicinal purposes, but the sweet orange was unknown until the late 15th century or the beginnings of the 16th century, when Italian and Portuguese merchants brought orange trees into the Mediterranean area. Shortly afterward, the sweet orange quickly was adopted as an edible fruit. It also was considered a luxury item and wealthy people grew oranges in private conservatories, called orangeries. By 1646, the sweet orange was well known throughout Europe.",

    "question": "How many pieces are there in a standard set of dominoes?",
    "answer": "28",
    "evidence": "Dominoes (or dominos) is a game played with rectangular \"domino\" tiles. The domino gaming pieces make up a domino set, sometimes called a deck or pack.  The traditional Sino-European domino set consists of 28 dominoes, colloquially nicknamed bones, cards, tiles, tickets, stones, or spinners. Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its face into two square ends. Each end is marked with a number of spots (also called pips, nips, or dobs) or is blank. The backs of the dominoes in a set are indistinguishable, either blank or having some common design. A domino set is a generic gaming device, similar to playing cards or dice, in that a variety of games can be played with a set.\n\nThe earliest mention of dominoes is from Song dynasty China, found in the text Former Events in Wulin. Dominoes first appeared in Italy during the 18th century, and although it is unknown how Chinese dominoes developed into the modern game, it is speculated that Italian missionaries in China may have brought the game to Europe. \n\nThe name \"domino\" is from the resemblance to a kind of hood worn during the Venice carnival.  \n\nConstruction and composition of domino sets\n\nEuropean-style dominoes are traditionally made of bone such as ivory, or a dark hardwood such as ebony, with contrasting black or white pips (inlaid or painted). Alternatively, domino sets have been made from many different natural materials: stone (e.g., marble, granite or soapstone); other hardwoods (e.g., ash, oak, redwood and cedar); metals (e.g., brass or pewter); ceramic clay, or even frosted glass or crystal. These sets have a more novel look, and the often heavier weight makes them feel more substantial; also, such materials and the resulting products are usually much more expensive than polymer materials.",

    "answer": "The Jubilee Line",
    "evidence": "Infrastructure\n\nRailway\n\nThe Underground serves 270 stations.  Fourteen Underground stations are outside Greater London, of which five (Amersham, Chalfont & Latimer, Chesham, and Chorleywood on the Metropolitan line, and Epping on the Central line), are beyond the M25 London Orbital motorway. Of the 32 London boroughs, six (Bexley, Bromley, Croydon, Kingston, Lewisham and Sutton) are not served by the Underground network, while Hackney has Old Street and Manor House only just inside its boundaries. Lewisham used to be served by the East London Line (stations at New Cross and New Cross Gate). The line and the stations were transferred to the London Overground  network in 2010 \n\nLondon Underground's eleven lines total 402 km in length, making it the third longest metro system in the world. These are made up of the sub-surface network and the deep-tube lines.  The Circle, District, Hammersmith & City, and Metropolitan lines form the sub-surface network, with railway tunnels just below the surface and of a similar size to those on British main lines. The Hammersmith & City and Circle lines share stations and most of their track with each other, as well as with the Metropolitan and District lines. The Bakerloo, Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria and Waterloo & City lines are deep-level tubes, with smaller trains that run in two circular tunnels (tubes) with a diameter about 11 ft. These lines have the exclusive use of a pair of tracks, except for the Piccadilly line, which shares track with the District line between Acton Town and Hanger Lane Junction and with the Metropolitan line between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge; and the Bakerloo line, which shares track with London Overground services north of Queen's Park.\nThe Victoria line is a deep-level London Underground route running from Brixton in the south in Zone 2 to Walthamstow Central in the north-east in Zone 3 of London. It is coloured light blue on the Tube map. It is one of two underground lines to run entirely below ground, the other being the Waterloo & City line. Constructed in the 1960s, it was the first entirely new tube line in London for fifty years, and was designed to relieve congestion on other lines, in particular the Piccadilly line and the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line. The line has always been operated using automatic train operation, but all trains carry drivers.\n\nThe Victoria line is used by 200\u00a0million passengers each year, making it the sixth most heavily used line on the network in absolute figures, but in terms of the average number of journeys per mile it is by far the most intensively used line.\n\nHistory\n\nPlanning and construction\n\nA tube railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party set up by the British Transport Commission in 1948, though that largely followed a 1946 plan for a Croydon to Finsbury Park line. The main purpose was to relieve congestion in the central area. The necessary Private Bill was introduced into Parliament in 1955. It described a line from Victoria to Walthamstow (Wood Street). There was also a proposal, though not included in the Bill, for a subsequent extension from Victoria to Fulham Broadway station on the District line. \n\nConstruction began in 1962 on the initial Walthamstow to Victoria section, opening Walthamstow to Highbury on 1 September 1968.  A test tunnel from Tottenham to Manor House under Seven Sisters Road had been bored in 1959 and was later incorporated into the running tunnels.",

    "evidence": "The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious person\u00e6 to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.\n\nThe successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment. His notoriety caused the play, despite its early success, to be closed after 86\u00a0performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work.",

    "evidence": "English loanwords and calques in other languages \n\nEnglish has a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages. The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages. That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.\n\nWriting system \n\nSince the ninth century, English has been written in a Latin alphabet (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in Anglo-Saxon runes are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.

    "evidence": "In music, flat, or bemolle (Italian: \"soft B\") means \"lower in pitch\". In music notation, the flat symbol,  derived from a stylised lowercase \"b\", lowers a note by a half step (semitone).   Intonation or tuning is said to be flat when it is below the true pitch.\n\nFlat accidentals are used in the key signatures of F major/D minor, B-flat major/G minor, E-flat major/C minor, A-flat major/F minor, D-flat major/B-flat minor, and the less frequently used keys of G-flat major/E-flat minor, C-flat major/A-flat minor. The order of flats in the key signatures of music notation, following the circle of fifths, is B, E, A, D, G, C, and F. A mnemonic for this is: Before Eating A Doughnut Get Coffee First.\n\nThe Unicode character \u266d (U+266D) can be found in the block Miscellaneous Symbols; its HTML entity is \u266d.\n\nUnder twelve tone equal temperament, C-flat for instance is the same as, or enharmonically equivalent to, B-natural (B), and G-flat is the same as F-sharp (F). In any other tuning system, such enharmonic equivalences in general do not exist. To allow extended just intonation, composer Ben Johnston uses a sharp as an accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 cents (ratio 25:24), and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents. \n\nDouble flats also exist, which look like  (similar to two flats, ) and lower a note by two semitones, or a whole step. Less often (for instance in microtonal music notation) one will encounter half, or three-quarter, or otherwise altered flats. The Unicode character \ud834\udd2b (U+1D12B) in the Musical Symbols block represents the double-flat sign.\n\nAlthough very uncommon and only used in modern classical music, a triple flat () can sometimes be found. It lowers a note three semitones. \n\nA half flat, indicating the use of quarter tones, may be marked with various symbols including a flat with a slash () or a reversed flat sign (). A three-quarter flat, or sesquiflat, is represented by a half flat and a regular flat ().\nThe relative minor is a minor third down from the major, regardless of whether it is a flat or a sharp key signature.\n\nThe key signatures with seven flats () and seven sharps () are rarely used because they have simpler enharmonic equivalents. For example, the key of C major (seven sharps) is more simply represented as D major (five flats). For modern practical purposes these keys are (in twelve tone equal temperament) the same, because C and D are enharmonically the same note. Pieces are written in these extreme sharp or flat keys, however: for example, Bach's Prelude and Fugue No. 3 from Book 1 of The Well-Tempered Clavier BWV 848 is in C major. The modern musical Seussical by Flaherty and Ahrens also has several songs written in these extreme keys.\n\nThe key signature may be changed at any time in a piece, usually at the beginning of a measure, simply by notating the new signature, although if the new signature has no sharps or flats, a signature of naturals, as shown, cancels the preceding signature.\n\nVariants of standard conventions \n\nIn strictly correct, traditional use, when the key signature change goes from sharps to flats or vice-versa, the old key signature should be cancelled with the appropriate number of naturals before the new one is inserted; but many more recent publications (whether of newer music or newer editions of older music) dispense with the naturals and simply insert the new signature.\n\nSimilarly, when a signature with either flats or sharps in it changes to a smaller signature of the same type, strict application of tradition or convention would require that naturals first be used to cancel just those flats or sharps that are being subtracted in the new signature before the new signature itself is written; but, again, more modern usage often dispenses with these naturals.",

It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the  north-west, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the south-east. It borders Belgium and  Luxembourg in the north east. It also borders Germany and Switzerland in the east,  Italy and Monaco in the south-east, Spain and Andorra in the south west. The borders in the south and in the east of the country are mountain ranges: the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Jura, the border in the east is from the Rhine river, while the border in the north and the north east melts in no natural elements. Due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as ' (\"The Hexagon\"). Metropolitan France includes various islands: Corsica and coastal islands. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41\u00b0 and 51\u00b0 N, and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 10\u00b0 E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone.

The books have gained worldwide attention, won multiple awards, and sold more than 400\u00a0million copies.  They have become the best-selling book series in history  and been the basis for a series of films which is the second highest-grossing film series in history.  Rowling had overall approval on the scripts  and maintained creative control by serving as a producer on the final instalment. \n\nBorn in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband and relative poverty until she finished the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, in 1997. There were six sequels, the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written four books for adult readers, The Casual Vacancy (2012) and\u2014under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith\u2014the crime fiction novels The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014) and Career of Evil (2015).\nBook of the Year\n\nSeamus Heaney, Beowulf\n\nChildren's Book\n\nWinner:\n*J.

His overall view of the series was negative \u2013 \"the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain\", and he speaks of \"a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style\".  Ursula K. Le Guin said, \"I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the 'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, I read it to find out what the fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a \"school novel\", good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited.\"",

According to William Wei, the movement was \"rooted in a past history of oppression and a present struggle for liberation.\"  This occurred around the same time as the Chicano movement, Civil Rights movement, American Indian Movement and the gay liberation movement.\n\nNotable contributions\n\nArts and entertainment\n\nSee also: Asian-American literature\n\nAsian Americans have been involved in the entertainment industry since the first half of the 19th century, when Chang and Eng Bunker (the original \"Siamese Twins\") became naturalized citizens.  Acting roles in television, film, and theater were relatively few, and many available roles were for narrow, stereotypical characters. More recently, young Asian American comedians and film-makers have found an outlet on YouTube allowing them to gain a strong and loyal fanbase among their fellow Asian Americans.  There have been several Asian American-centric television shows in American media, beginning with Mr. T and Tina in 1976, and as recent as Fresh Off the Boat in 2015.\nThroughout the 1990s there was a growing amount of Asian American queer writings  and today the list of contributing writers is long. To name a few: Merle Woo (1941), [http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3403600274/kim-willyce.html Willyce Kim] (1946), Russel Leong (1950), [http://www.browsebiography.com/bio-kitty_tsui.html Kitty Tsui] (1952), Dwight Okita (1958), Norman Wong (1963), [https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/timothy-liu Tim Liu] (1965), Chay Yew (1965) and Justin Chin (1969).\n\nBusiness\nThe signature of King Mongkut (r. 1851 \u2013 1868) reads SPPM (Somdet Phra Poramenthra Maha) Mongkut King of the Siamese, giving the name \"Siam\" official status until 23 June 1939 when it was changed to Thailand.  Thailand was renamed Siam from 1945 to 11 May 1949, after which it again reverted to Thailand.\n\nEtymology of \"Thailand\"\n\nAccording to George C\u0153d\u00e8s, the word Thai (\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22) means \"free man\" in the Thai language, \"differentiating the Thai from the natives encompassed in Thai society as serfs.\" A famous Thai scholar argued that Thai () simply means \"people\" or \"human being\", since his investigation shows that in some rural areas the word \"Thai\" was used instead of the usual Thai word \"khon\" (\u0e04\u0e19) for people. \n\nWhile Thai people will often refer to their country using the polite form prathet Thai (), they most commonly use the more colloquial term mueang Thai () or simply Thai, the word mueang, archaically a city-state, commonly used to refer to a city or town as the centre of a region. Ratcha Anachak Thai () means \"kingdom of Thailand\" or \"kingdom of Thai\". Etymologically, its components are: ratcha (Sanskrit raja \"king, royal, realm\") ; -ana- (Pali \u0101\u1e47\u0101 \"authority, command, power\", itself from an Old Indo-Aryan form \u0101j\u00f1\u0101 of the same meaning) -chak (from Sanskrit  cakra- \"wheel\", a symbol of power and rule). The Thai National Anthem (), written by Luang Saranupraphan during the extremely patriotic 1930s, refers to the Thai nation as: prathet Thai (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22).

    "evidence": "Donald Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002.  He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character,  and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre. \n\nDonald Duck rose to fame with his comedic roles in animated cartoons. Donald's first appearance was in 1934 in The Wise Little Hen, but it was his second appearance in Orphan's Benefit which introduced him as a temperamental comic foil to Mickey Mouse. Throughout the next two decades Donald appeared in over 150 theatrical films, several of which were recognized at the Academy Awards. In the 1930s, he typically appeared as part of a comic trio with Mickey and Goofy, and was given his own film series in 1937 starting with Don Donald. These films introduced Donald's love interest Daisy Duck and often included his three nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. After the 1956 film Chips Ahoy, Donald appeared primarily in educational films before eventually returning to theatrical animation in Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983). His most recent appearance in a theatrical film was 1999's Fantasia 2000. Donald has also appeared in direct-to-video features such as Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers (2004), television series such as Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006\u20132013), and video games such as QuackShot (1991).\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie Duck are triplet cartoon characters created in 1937 by writer Ted Osborne and cartoonist Al Taliaferro, and are licensed by The Walt Disney Company. Huey, Dewey, and Louie are the nephews of Donald Duck and the grandnephews of Scrooge McDuck. Like their uncles, the boys are anthropomorphic white ducks with yellow-orange beaks and feet. They typically wear shirts and colorful baseball caps, which are sometimes used to differentiate each character. Huey, Dewey and Louie have made several animated appearances in both films and television, but comics remain their primary medium. The trio are collectively the 11th most published comic book characters in the world, and outside of the superhero genre, second only to Donald. \n\nWhile the boys were originally created as mischief-makers to provoke their uncle's famous temper, later appearances showed them to be valuable assets to their uncles on their adventures. All three of the boys are members of the fictional Scouting organization, The Junior Woodchucks.\n\nOrigins\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie were the idea of Al Taliaferro, the artist for the Silly Symphonies comic strip, which featured Donald Duck. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short, Donald's Nephews. The nephews debuted in Taliaferro's comic strip, which by this time had been renamed Donald Duck, on Sunday, October 17, 1937, beating the theatrical release of Donald's Nephews by almost six months. The names were devised by Disney gag man Dana Coty, who took them from Huey Long, Thomas Dewey, and Louis Schmitt, an animator at the Disney Studio in the 1930s and 1940s. Taliaferro's introduction of the nephews emulated the three nephews in the Happy Hooligan comic strip and was also influenced by Mickey Mouse's nephews, Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse.\nDonald's Nephews (1938) is a Donald Duck animated cartoon which features Donald being visited by his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. This cartoon is Huey, Dewey, and Louie's very first appearance in animation.   The short, and the three nephews, was the idea of Al Taliaferro, the artist for the Silly Symphonies comic strip, which featured Donald Duck. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short.  Taliaferro subsequently introduced the nephews in his comic strip, which by this time had been renamed Donald Duck, on Sunday, October 17, 1937, beating the theatrical release of Donald's Nephews by almost six months. \n\nPlot\n\nDonald receives a postcard from his sister, Dumbella, which says that her three boys, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, are coming to visit him. At first Donald is excited to see his nephews, but soon the boys start causing problems, being a constant annoyance to their uncle.\n\nDonald consults a book entitled Modern Child Training, and tries to use the suggestions to gain control over his nephews, but things only get worse. In the end, after the boys leave and with his house left almost destroyed, Donald spots a page which reads \"After all, little children are only angels without wings\".

The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages. That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.\n\nWriting system \n\nSince the ninth century, English has been written in a Latin alphabet (also called Roman alphabet).

When he combines with Inky, Kinky's glasses appear on Inky's body and grant this new combined ghost (named Stylist) the ability to split in two. Stylist's reflection will mirror Stylist's movements on the other half of the map (about the vertical axis). When Kinky combines with Pinky, the resulting ghost is rabbit-like and named Romp. Romp can hop to any part of the map, usually very close to Pac-Man's position. The combination of Kinky and Blinky (who is orange in Pac-Man Arrangement) results in Crybaby, a chubbier version of Blinky who adds 20-point Pac-Dots to the maze.\n* Orson / Toc-Man - a greenish-gray intellectual Ghost who initially appears as the main antagonist of Pac-Man World under the alias of Toc-Man. In Pac-Man World 3, Orson has reformed and is now an ally of Pac-Man.\n* Spooky - a dark gray Ghost in gray armor that is the King of the Ghosts in ancient times until he was sealed under Pac-Ville's largest tree by Sir Pac-A-Lot.\n* Funky - a jumping green Ghost that debuted in the game Pac-Mania.

She is a counterpart of Funky.\n* Sue - is the female counterpart of Clyde in Ms. Pac-Man, entirely identical to him. In the Pac-Man series, Sue (voiced by Susan Silo) is featured as Clyde's second-in-command. She also appears in Pac-Mania colored purple with mascara and eyeshadow, greatly resembling her cartoon counterpart. \n* Tim - is an orange Ghost that appeared exclusively as Clyde's replacement in Jr. Pac-Man.",

    "answer": "Blade Runner",
    "evidence": "Harrison Ford (born July 13, 1942) is an American actor and film producer. He gained worldwide fame for his starring roles as Han Solo in the original Star Wars epic space opera trilogy and the title character of the Indiana Jones film series. Ford is also known for his roles as Rick Deckard in the neo-noir dystopian science fiction film Blade Runner (1982), John Book in the thriller Witness (1985), and Jack Ryan in the action films Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994). Most recently, Ford reprised his role of Han Solo in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015).\n\nHis career has spanned six decades and includes roles in several Hollywood blockbusters; including the epic war film Apocalypse Now (1979), the legal drama Presumed Innocent (1990), the action film The Fugitive (1993), the political action thriller Air Force One (1997) and the psychological thriller What Lies Beneath (2000). Seven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry: American Graffiti (1973), The Conversation (1974), Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Blade Runner.\n\nIn 1997, Ford was ranked No. 1 in Empires \"The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time\" list. As of 2016, the U.S. domestic box-office grosses of Ford's films total over US$4.7\u00a0billion, with worldwide grosses surpassing $6\u00a0billion, making Ford the highest-grossing U.S. domestic box-office star.  Ford is married to actress Calista Flockhart, who is known for playing the title role in the comedy-drama series Ally McBeal.\n\nEarly life\nComic book\n\nBOOM! Studios published a 24-issue comic book limited series based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? containing the full text of the novel illustrated by artist Tony Parker.  The comic garnered a nomination for \"Best New Series\" from the 2010 Eisner Awards. \n\nPrequel Comic book\n\nIn May 2010 BOOM! Studios began serializing an eight issue prequel subtitled Dust To Dust and written by Chris Roberson and drawn by Robert Adler.  The story took place in the days immediately after World War Terminus. \n\nSequels\n\nThree novels intended to serve as sequels to both Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Blade Runner have been published:\n#Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (1995),\n#Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night (1996),\n#Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon (2000).\nThese official and authorized sequels were written by Dick's friend, K. W. Jeter. They continue the story of Rick Deckard and attempt to reconcile many of the differences between the novel and the film.\n\nCritical reception\nBlade Runner is a 1982 American tech noir science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott, and starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos. The screenplay, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is a modified film adaptation of the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick.\n\nThe film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in which genetically engineered replicants, which are visually indistinguishable from adult humans, are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation. The use of replicants on Earth is banned and they are exclusively utilized for dangerous or menial work on off-world colonies. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and killed (\"retired\") by special police operatives known as \"Blade Runners\". The plot focuses on a group of recently escaped replicants hiding in L.A. and the burnt-out expert Blade Runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down.\n\nBlade Runner initially polarized critics: some were displeased with the pacing, while others enjoyed its thematic complexity. The year following its release, the film won the prestigious  Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Blade Runner underperformed in North American theaters, but has since become a cult film.  Hailed for its production design, depicting a \"retrofitted\" future,  it remains a leading example of the neo-noir genre.  It brought the work of Philip K. Dick to the attention of Hollywood and several later films were based on his work.  Ridley Scott regards Blade Runner as \"probably\" his most complete and personal film.   In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Blade Runner is now regarded by many critics as one of the best science fiction films ever made.",

Pat O'Malley as Otto (a dog)\n\nAlthough at least five of the voice-actors utilized were British, the decision was made to cast quite a number of American character actors in the traditional medieval roles. Many of these individuals were veteran performers from Western-themed movies and television programs, which meant that characters like Little John, Friar Tuck, and the Sheriff of Nottingham have distinctly American accents and mannerisms. This effect was further reinforced by the choice of country singer Roger Miller as the movie's songwriter and narrator.\n\nProduction \n\nInitially, the studio considered a movie about Reynard the Fox. However, due to Walt Disney's concern that Reynard was an unsuitable choice for a hero, the project languished.  Ken Anderson used the central element of an animated fox in Robin Hood, however.\nCorporate history \n\n1923\u201328: The silent era \n\nIn early 1923, Kansas City, Missouri, animator Walt Disney created a short film entitled Alice's Wonderland, which featured child actress Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters. After the bankruptcy in 1923 of his previous firm, Laugh-O-Gram Studios,  Disney moved to Hollywood to join his brother, Roy O. Disney.  Film distributor Margaret J. Winkler of M.J. Winkler Productions contacted Disney with plans to distribute a whole series of Alice Comedies purchased for $1,500 per reel with Disney as a production partner.  Walt and Roy Disney formed Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio that same year. More animated films followed after Alice.  In January 1926, with the completion of the Disney studio on Hyperion Street, the Disney Brothers Studio's name was changed to the Walt Disney Studio.\n\nAfter the demise of the Alice comedies, Disney developed an all-cartoon series starring his first original character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, which was distributed by Winkler Pictures through Universal Pictures. The distributor owned Oswald, so Disney only made a few hundred dollars. Disney completed 26 Oswald shorts before losing the contract in February 1928, due to a legal loophole, when Winkler's husband Charles Mintz took over their distribution company. After failing to take over the Disney Studio, Mintz hired away four of Disney's primary animators (the exception being Ub Iwerks) to start his own animation studio, Snappy Comedies.\n\n1928\u201334: Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies",

    "answer": "Neil Morrissey",
    "evidence": "Bob the Builder is a British children's animated television show created by Keith Chapman. In the original series, Bob appears as a building contractor specialising in masonry in a stop motion animated programme with his colleague Wendy, various neighbours and friends, and their gang of anthropomorphised work-vehicles and equipment. The show is broadcast in many countries, but originates from the United Kingdom where Bob is voiced by English actor Neil Morrissey. The show was later created using CGI animation starting with the spin-off series Ready, Steady, Build!.\n\nIn each episode, Bob and his group help with renovations, construction, and repairs and with other projects as needed. The show emphasises conflict resolution, co-operation, socialisation and various learning skills. Bob's catchphrase is \"Can we fix it?\", to which the other characters respond with \"Yes we can!\" This phrase is also the title of the show's theme song, which was a million-selling number one hit in the UK.\n\nIn October 2014, Bob the Builder was revamped by Mattel for a new series to be aired on Channel 5's Milkshake! in 2015. Amongst the changes were a complete overhaul of the cast, with Harry Potter actor Lee Ingleby replacing Neil Morrissey as the voice of Bob, and Joanne Froggatt and Blake Harrison were also confirmed as the voices of Wendy and Scoop respectively. The setting and appearance of the characters also changed, with Bob and his team moving to the bustling metropolis of Spring City.

But this superior sequel has romance in its dark heart.\" Empire magazine gave it two out of five stars, calling it \"laughable to just plain boring, Hannibal is toothless to the end.\" David Thomson, writing in the British Film Institute magazine Sight & Sound, praised the film. \"It works. It's smart, good-looking, sexy, fun...dirty, naughty and knowing.\" Thomson does make clear, however, he is a great fan of director Ridley Scott's work. He adds: \"It is, literally, that Hannibal Lecter has become such a household joke that he can't be dreadful again. It seems clear that Anthony Hopkins and Scott saw that, and planned accordingly. That's how the movie was saved.\" Variety magazine in its review said \"Hannibal is not as good as Lambs... ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor, Hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing and occasionally startling.\" \n\nA negative review in The Guardian claimed that what was wrong with the film was carried over from the book: \"The result is an inflated, good-looking bore of a movie. The Silence of the Lambs was a marvelous thing. This, by contrast is barely okey-dokey.\"  Roger Ebert gave the film a \"Thumbs down\" rating on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper and gave the film a 2.5 out of 4 stars rating in his print review, which he began with the following: \"Ridley Scott's Hannibal is a carnival geek show. We must give it credit for the courage of its depravity; if it proves nothing else, it proves that if a man cutting off his face and feeding it to his dogs doesn't get the NC-17 rating for violence, nothing ever will.\"  Hannibal has an overall Metacritic rating of 57 out of 100 from 36 reviews and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 39%, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10 from 163 reviews. \n\nDifferences from the novel\nIt has a 76% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with its critics consensus being: \"Though it's light on character development and cultural empathy, Black Hawk Down is a visceral, pulse-pounding portrait of war, elevated by Ridley Scott's superb technical skill.\"  It has a rating of 74 on Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". \n\nThe film has had a small cultural legacy, which has been studied academically by media analysts dissecting how media reflects American perceptions of war. Newsweek writer Evan Thomas considered the movie one of the most culturally significant films of the George W. Bush presidency. He suggested that although the film was presented as being anti-war, it was at its core pro-war. He further wrote that \"though it depicted a shameful defeat, the soldiers were heroes willing to die for their brothers in arms[...] The movie showed brutal scenes of killing, but also courage, stoicism and honor[...] The overall effect was stirring, if slightly pornographic, and it seemed to enhance the desire of Americans for a thumping war to avenge 9/11.\" \n\nStephen A. Klien, writing in Critical Studies in Media Communication, argued that the film's sensational rendering of war had the effect of encouraging audiences to empathize with the film's pro-soldier leitmotif. He suggested that this in turn served to \"conflate personal support of American soldiers with support of American military policy\" and discourage \"critical public discourse concerning justification for and execution of military interventionist policy.\" \n\nSoundtrack\n\nAccolades \n\nBlack Hawk Down received four Academy Award nominations for Best Director (lost to A Beautiful Mind) and Best Cinematography (lost to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring) and won two Oscars for Best Sound and Best Film Editing.

Hill and her sister were honored at the Chicago World's Fair for their work in the progressive education program at the experimental kindergarten, the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School.\n\nShe wrote about music using the pen name Johann Tonsor,  and her 1892 article \"Negro Music\", suggesting that the existing body of black music would be the basis of a distinctive American musical style, influenced Dvo\u0159\u00e1k in composing the New World Symphony. \n\nHill died in Chicago, Illinois, in 1916,  long before her song became famous. She is buried with her sister in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nMildred Hill's manuscripts and papers are held by the University of Louisville Music Library in Louisville, Kentucky. \n\n\"Happy Birthday to You\"\n\nWhile teaching at the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School, the Hill sisters wrote the song \"Good Morning to All\"; Mildred wrote the melody, and Patty the lyrics. The song was first published in 1893 in Song Stories for the Kindergarten  as a greeting song for teachers to sing to their students.\nMusic\n\nThe breadth of music in Kentucky is indeed wide, stretching from the Purchase to the eastern mountains.\n\nRenfro Valley, Kentucky is home to Renfro Valley Entertainment Center and the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame and is known as \"Kentucky's Country Music Capital\", a designation given it by the Kentucky State Legislature in the late 1980s. The Renfro Valley Barn Dance was where Renfro Valley's musical heritage began, in 1939, and influential country music luminaries like Red Foley, Homer & Jethro, Lily May Ledford & the Original Coon Creek Girls, Martha Carson, and many others have performed as regular members of the shows there over the years. The Renfro Valley Gatherin' is today America's second oldest continually broadcast radio program of any kind. It is broadcast on local radio station WRVK and a syndicated network of nearly 200 other stations across the United States and Canada every week.\n\nContemporary Christian music star Steven Curtis Chapman is a Paducah native, and Rock and Roll Hall of Famers The Everly Brothers are closely connected with Muhlenberg County, where older brother Don was born. Merle Travis, Country & Western artist known for both his signature \"Travis picking\" guitar playing style, as well as his hit song \"Sixteen Tons\", was also born in Muhlenberg County. Kentucky was also home to Mildred and Patty Hill, the Louisville sisters credited with composing the tune to the ditty Happy Birthday to You in 1893; Loretta Lynn (Johnson County), Brian Littrell and Kevin Richardson of the Backstreet Boys, and Billy Ray Cyrus (Flatwoods).",

Blue has been used as a symbol of political affiliation as with the Manners family who bought a number of inns in Grantham, all of which they renamed to include the word blue to show their allegiance to the Whig Party, or may have arisen incidentally, as with the Blue Pig in Telford, which acquired the name due to the local workers producing blue pig iron.  \n\nOther popular colours are red, as in Red Bull and Red Lion (one of the most popular pub names, with over 600 examples); black, as in Black Horse, Black Bear, and Black Cap; and green, as in Green Man.\n\nPub names as a brand\n\nSome pub chains in the UK adopt the same or similar names for many pubs as a means of brand expression.

    "question": "What is the name of Kevin the teenager's friend played by Kathy Burke in a series of sketches with Harry Enfield?",
    "answer": "Perry",
    "evidence": "Kevin Patterson is a character created and played by the British comedian, Harry Enfield.\n\nEvolution\n\nKevin originated in the \"Little Brother\" sketches of Harry Enfield's Television Programme as an annoyingly energetic boy who constantly vexed his older brother with his irritating catchphrases and habit of bursting into his room when he was with a girl.\n\nIn the first episode of Harry Enfield and Chums (the new name for the show), Kevin, who despite the same name and similar initial manner was actually separate from the earlier character, reached his thirteenth birthday. The sketch showed his parents watching in horror as Kevin lost his sense of dress, courtesy and posture as the clock struck midnight on the day of his thirteenth birthday, thus becoming Kevin the Teenager, one of the most memorable of Enfield's comic creations.\n\nPersonality\n\nWearing a baseball cap the wrong way round and with his red hair flopping over his face, Kevin is rude to his despairing parents, frequently shouting \"I hate you, I wish I'd never been born!\" at them, and insisting that everything is \"so unfair!\". In one sketch, when his father asks him to wash his car, Kevin ends up taking the entire day to complete the task due to his inability to get out of bed before noon and an apparent allergy to work, and in another sketch, though wide awake, he made the most primitive of attempts at tidying his room when required to do so.  The character is also heavily dictated by peer pressure, and was seen in various other sketches trying to sound like Ali G, or Liam Gallagher.   \n\nHis best friend is another teenaged boy named Perry (played by the actress Kathy Burke, and based on an early character Burke portrayed on various Channel 4 shows).  They starred in a 2000 feature film, Kevin & Perry Go Large.\nKatherine Lucy Bridget Burke (born 13 June 1964) is an English actress, comedian, playwright and theatre director. She became known for her regular appearances in the sketch shows French and Saunders (1988\u201399), Harry Enfield's Television Programme (1990\u201392) and Harry Enfield and Chums (1994\u201398), and for her recurring role as Magda in the BBC sitcom Absolutely Fabulous (1992\u201396). For her role as Valerie in the film Nil by Mouth, she won Best Actress at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.\n\nBurke made her film debut in Scrubbers in 1983, and played Mary I in the 1998 film Elizabeth. Her other film appearances include Dancing at Lughnasa (1998), This Year's Love (1999), Kevin & Perry Go Large (2000), The Martins (2001), and Anita and Me (2002). From 1999 to 2001, she starred as Linda La Hughes in the BBC sitcom Gimme Gimme Gimme, for which she received two of her five BAFTA TV Award nominations. Having spent most of the 2000s concentrating on her work as a director, she returned to film roles in the 2010s with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), Pan (2015) and Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie (2016).\n\nEarly life\n\nBurke was born at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London, and was brought up in Islington. She has two elder brothers, John and Barry. Her mother, Bridget (Bridie),  died of cancer when she was two, and she was brought up by neighbours (the Galvin family) for the following few years. Subsequently, she returned to live with her Irish father, Patrick (Paddy), a builder who died of cancer in 1985. Burke attended the Maria Fidelis RC Convent School.   She then studied theatre at the Anna Scher Theatre.\n\nCareer\nHistorically, the sketches tended to be unrelated, but more recent groups have introduced overarching themes that connect the sketches within a particular show, with recurring characters that return for more than one appearance. Examples of recurring characters include Mr. Gumby from Monty Python's Flying Circus; Ted and Ralph from The Fast Show; The Family from The Carol Burnett Show; the Head Crusher from The Kids in the Hall; Martin Short's Ed Grimley, a recurring character from both SCTV and Saturday Night Live;  and Kevin and Perry from Harry Enfield and Chums. The idea of running characters was taken a stage further with shows like The Red Green Show and The League of Gentlemen, where sketches centered on the various inhabitants of the fictional towns of Possum Lake and Royston Vasey, respectively.\n\nIn North America, contemporary sketch comedy is largely an outgrowth of the improvisational comedy scene that flourished during the 1970s, largely growing out of The Second City in Chicago and Toronto.\n\nNotable contemporary American stage sketch comedy groups include The Second City, the Upright Citizens Brigade, The Groundlings and the cast of Saturday Night Live.\n\nFilms\n\nSketch films are rare, since the genre is associated with TV and theatre. The more popular ones were made during the '70s and '80s: The Groove Tube, Kentucky Fried Movie (and its sequel Amazon Women on the Moon) and the Monty Python movies. There have been a few sketch films in recent times, but they've been critical and financial failures: The Underground Comedy Movie (and its sequel InAPPropriate Comedy) and Movie 43.\n\nFestivals\n\nMany of the sketch comedy revues in Britain included seasons at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.",

    "evidence": "Four-division period and SPL split\n\nAfter a couple of decades, the league again reorganised, with four divisions of 10 clubs, as  Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Ross County were elected to round out the league. At the same time, the SFL adopted the system of three points for a win.  In 1998 the Premier Division clubs split from the league to form the Scottish Premier League (SPL). The remaining leagues, of ten clubs each, kept their names and the Premier Division was not reconstituted, leaving First, Second and Third Divisions. Part of the agreement was that the SPL would expand to 12 clubs in 2000. The SFL then took in two new members to replace the two clubs lost to the SPL. Highland League clubs Elgin City and Peterhead were admitted, increasing the total number of clubs in the Scottish football league system to 42.\n\nFrom 2005, the SFL determined a promotion and relegation place between each division according to playoffs between four clubs. The playoffs were contested between the ninth placed (second bottom) club in the higher division and the second, third and fourth placed clubs in the lower division. It was therefore possible for a team finishing fourth in the Second Division or Third Division to be promoted, rather than the clubs finishing immediately above them in the standings. It was also possible for the ninth placed club to retain their position in the higher division.\n\nIn March 2007, a self-conducted review found the league to be three times more expensive to run than equivalent leagues in England, with a report stating the league structure was \"outdated\". The report found that the Football Conference has four employees looking after 68 clubs, while the SFL had 14 people running leagues with just 30 clubs. \n\nMerger",

In the United States and United Kingdom it was known as Prisoner: Cell Block H, with the same title and Caged Women in Canada. The series, produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation, aired on Network Ten for 692 episodes between 27 February 1979 and 11 December 1986. Originally, it was planned as a 16-part series.\n\nThe show was inspired by the British television drama Within These Walls, which was moderately successful in Australia. The Prisoner producers approached Googie Withers of Within These Walls to play the prison governor, but she declined. Due to an injunction requested by UK-based ATV, which considered the title too similar to their The Prisoner, overseas broadcasters had to change the series' name. In March 2012 it was announced that Prisoner would be \"reimagined\" on Foxtel in a new version, Wentworth.   \n\nBackground\n\nPrisoner was created by Reg Watson, who had produced the British soap opera Crossroads from 1964 to 1973 and would create Australian soaps The Young Doctors, Sons and Daughters and Neighbours. Initially conceived as a 16-episode series, the working title of the pilot episode was \"Women Behind Bars\". Its storylines focused on the lives of the prisoners and, to a lesser extent, the officers and other prison staff.

He is also known for his roles as Simon Wicks in the British soap opera EastEnders from 1985 to 1990 (followed by a brief re-appearance in January 2012).\n\nCareer\n\nBerry started acting at the age of eight. After attending the Sylvia Young Theatre School in London he played minor parts on television, film, and stage before he got his big break playing Simon 'Wicksy' Wicks in the popular BBC soap opera EastEnders, joining the series just after its inception in 1985 and staying until the end of 1990. Berry's character was thought up overnight and had been scheduled to appear later, however he was introduced to restore the cast balance distorted by the unexpected departure of actor David Scarboro who played the original Mark Fowler. Scarboro's departure meant many of his functions as one of the more senior of the young characters would need to be taken over by another character and thus Wicksy was introduced rather sooner than originally planned and Berry was cast with minimal delay. He was quickly hailed as EastEnders top pin-up and during this time was besieged by fanmail from female admirers.\n\nBerry soon took a break from EastEnders to tour and make an album from which the number one single 'Every Loser Wins' came in 1986. The song was heavily featured within EastEnders in a plotline referred to as The Banned in which the youths of Walford all formed a pop group and performed the songs on screen. It was the second biggest selling single in the UK that year, remaining at number one for three weeks. Its composers Simon May, Stewart James and Bradley James each received an Ivor Novello Award.

He has a low intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as \"creatively brilliant in his stupidity\". Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and \"is devoted to his stomach\". His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to \"change ... his mind when things go badly\". Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode \"Duffless\" (season four, 1993) as a full-blown alcoholic.  He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short \"Family Portrait\". According to Matt Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation,  because doing so \"seems sadistic. If we keep it that he's ruled by his impulses, then he can easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily.\" Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would \"always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back\", but this was dropped.  Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.",

    "answer": "Sheep",
    "evidence": "Folklore\n\nIn the absence of hard facts as to haggis' origins, popular folklore has provided some notions. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers. When the men left the Highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glens. They used the ingredients that were most readily available in their homes and conveniently packaged them in a sheep's stomach allowing for easy transportation during the journey. Other speculations have been based on Scottish slaughtering practices. When a chieftain or laird required an animal to be slaughtered for meat (whether sheep or cattle) the workmen were allowed to keep the offal as their share.\n\nA joke sometimes maintained is that a haggis is a small Scottish animal with longer legs on one side, so that it can run around the steep hills of the Scottish Highlands without falling over. According to one poll, 33% of American visitors to Scotland believed haggis to be an animal. \n\nModern use\n\nHaggis is traditionally served as part of the Burns supper on or near January 25, the birthday of Scotland's national poet Robert Burns. Burns wrote the poem Address to a Haggis, which starts \"Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o' the puddin-race!\" In Burns's lifetime haggis was a common dish of the poor as it was nourishing yet very cheap, being made from leftover parts of sheep otherwise thrown away.\n\nHaggis is widely available in supermarkets in Scotland all year, with cheaper brands normally packed in artificial casings, rather than stomachs. Sometimes haggis is sold in tins or a container which can be cooked in a microwave or conventional oven. Some commercial haggis is largely made from pig, rather than sheep, offal.

She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win twice, the only person to win twice in multiple sciences, and was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris.\n\nShe was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Floating University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister Bronis\u0142awa to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and with physicist Henri Becquerel. She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nHer achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity (a term that she coined   ), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today. During World War I, she established the first military field radiological centres.\n\nWhile a French citizen, Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie (she used both surnames)   never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland.  She named the first chemical element that she discoveredpolonium, which she isolated in 1898after her native country.\nLand use\n\nPoland is the fourth most forested country in Europe. Forests cover about 30.5% of Poland's land area based on international standards. Its overall percentage is still increasing. Forests of Poland are managed by the national program of reforestation (KPZL), aiming at an increase of forest-cover to 33% in 2050. The richness of Polish forest (per SoEF 2011 statistics) is more than twice as high as European average (with Germany and France at the top), containing 2.304 billion cubic metres of trees.  The largest forest complex in Poland is Lower Silesian Wilderness.\n\nMore than 1% of Poland's territory, 3145 km2, is protected within 23 Polish national parks. Three more national parks are projected for Masuria, the Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland, and the eastern Beskids. In addition, wetlands along lakes and rivers in central Poland are legally protected, as are coastal areas in the north.

Wiener the Rhesus group in 1937.   Development of the Coombs test in 1945, \nthe advent of transfusion medicine, and the understanding of ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn led to discovery of more blood groups, and now 33 human blood group systems are recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT), and in the 33 blood groups, over 600 blood group antigens have been found; many of these are rare or are mainly found in certain ethnic groups.\n\nCzech serologist Jan Jansk\u00fd is credited with the first classification of blood into the four types (A, B, AB, O) in 1907, which remains in use today. Blood types have been used in forensic science and were formerly used to demonstrate impossibility of paternity (e.g., a type AB man cannot be the father of a type O infant), but both of these uses are being replaced by genetic fingerprinting, which provides greater certainty. \n\nAccording to the [http://www.bmg.gv.at/home/EN/Home Austrian Federal Ministry of Health] the original terminology used by Karl Landsteiner in 1901 for the classification is A, B and 0 (zero); the \"O\" (oh) you find in the ABO group system is actually a subsequent variation occurred during the translation process, probably due to the similar shape between the number 0 and the letter O.\n\nSociety and culture",

    "question": "Which King did Guy Fawkes attempt to kill with his gunpowder plot?",
    "answer": "James I",
    "evidence": "Guy Fawkes (; 13 April 1570\u00a0\u2013 31 January 1606), also known as Guido Fawkes, the name he adopted while fighting for the Spanish, was a member of a group of provincial English Catholics who planned the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605.\n\nFawkes was born and educated in York.  His father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a recusant Catholic.  Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for the continent, where he fought in the Eighty Years' War on the side of Catholic Spain against Protestant Dutch reformers  in the Low Countries.  He travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England without success.  He later met Thomas Wintour, with whom he returned to England.\n\nWintour introduced Fawkes to Robert Catesby, who planned to assassinate  and restore a Catholic monarch to the throne.  The plotters leased an undercroft beneath the House of Lords, and Fawkes was placed in charge of the gunpowder they stockpiled there. Prompted by the receipt of an anonymous letter, the authorities searched Westminster Palace during the early hours of 5 November, and found Fawkes guarding the explosives. Over the next few days, he was questioned and tortured, and eventually he confessed.  Immediately before his execution on 31 January, Fawkes fell from the scaffold where he was to be hanged and broke his neck, thus avoiding the agony of the mutilation that followed.\n\nFawkes became synonymous with the Gunpowder Plot, the failure of which has been commemorated in Britain since 5 November 1605.  His effigy is traditionally burned on a bonfire, commonly accompanied by a fireworks display.\n\nEarly life\n\nChildhood\nThe Gunpowder Plot of 1605, in earlier centuries often called the Gunpowder Treason Plot or the Jesuit Treason, was a failed assassination attempt against King James I of England and VI of Scotland by a group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby.\n\nThe plan was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of England's Parliament on 5\u00a0November 1605, as the prelude to a popular revolt in the Midlands during which James's nine-year-old daughter, Princess Elizabeth, was to be installed as the Catholic head of state. Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters were John Wright, Thomas Wintour, Thomas Percy, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, Robert Wintour, Christopher Wright, John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham.  Fawkes, who had 10\u00a0years of military experience fighting in the Spanish Netherlands in suppression of the Dutch Revolt, was given charge of the explosives.\n\nThe plot was revealed to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to William Parker, 4th\u00a0Baron Monteagle, on 26\u00a0October 1605. During a search of the House of Lords at about midnight on 4\u00a0November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding 36\u00a0barrels of gunpowder\u2014enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble\u2014and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned of the plot's discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men at Holbeche House; in the ensuing battle, Catesby was one of those shot and killed. At their trial on 27\u00a0January 1606, eight of the survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered.",

He subsequently recorded the song with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra and the Ken Darby Singers and Chorus for Decca Records in just 18 minutes on May 29, 1942, and it was released on July 30 as part of an album of six 78-rpm discs from the musical film Holiday Inn. At first, Crosby did not see anything special about the song. He just said \"I don't think we have any problems with that one, Irving.\"  The song established and solidified the fact that there could be commercially successful secular Christmas songs  - in this case, written by a Jewish-American songwriter, who also wrote \"God Bless America.\"\n\nThe song initially performed poorly and was overshadowed by Holiday Inns first hit song: \"Be Careful, It's My Heart\". By the end of October 1942, \"White Christmas\" topped the Your Hit Parade chart.  It remained in that position until well into the new year.

He has three elder sisters. His father is Irish. He passed five O-Levels at Park School (renamed Oakfield School) but dropped out of school at 17 and moved to Harrow, London, which was the centre of the early 1980s British rockabilly revival scene. After his poem Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Work was published in 1987, his act developed from poetry to stand-up comedy. He took to performing at London's Comedy Store in 1985, was spotted on the touring circuit for the launch of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast in 1992 and co-presented The Word.\n\nCareer\n\nTelevision\n\nLamarr first came to the public's attention as a co-presenter of the early 1990s late night variety show The Word. The magazine format of the series allowed for interviews, live music, features and even game shows. The flexible late-night format meant that guests could do just about anything to be controversial.

    "question": "What is the name of the device made of wood and horsehair that is used to play a violin?",
    "answer": "Bow",
    "evidence": "To this day, instruments from the so-called Golden Age of violin making, especially those made by Stradivari, Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 and Montagnana are the most sought-after instruments by both collectors and performers.  The current record amount paid for a Stradivari violin is \u00a39.8 million (US$15.9 million), when the instrument known as the Lady Blunt was sold by Tarisio Auctions in an online auction on June 20, 2011. \n\nConstruction and mechanics\n\nA violin generally consists of a spruce top (the soundboard, also known as the top plate, table, or belly), maple ribs and back, two endblocks, a neck, a bridge, a soundpost, four strings, and various fittings, optionally including a chinrest, which may attach directly over, or to the left of, the tailpiece. A distinctive feature of a violin body is its hourglass-like shape and the arching of its top and back. The hourglass shape comprises two upper bouts, two lower bouts, and two concave C-bouts at the waist, providing clearance for the bow.\n\nThe voice of a violin depends on its shape, the wood it is made from, the graduation (the thickness profile) of both the top and back, and the varnish that coats its outside surface. The varnish and especially the wood continue to improve with age, making the fixed supply of old violins much sought-after.\nThe Central Asian theory is endorsed by Werner Bachmann, writing in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Bachmann notes evidence from a tenth-century Central Asian wall painting for bowed instruments in what is now the city of Kurbanshaid in Tajikistan.\n\nCircumstantial evidence also supports the Central Asian theory. All the elements that were necessary for the invention of the bow were probably present among the Central Asian horse riding peoples at the same time:\n\n*In a society of horse-mounted warriors (the horse peoples included the Huns and the Mongols), horsehair obviously would have been available.\n*Central Asian horse warriors specialized in the military bow, which could easily have served the inventor as a temporary way to hold horsehair at high tension.\n*To this day, horsehair for bows is taken from places with harsh cold climates, including Mongolia,  as such hair offers a better grip on the strings.\n*Rosin, crucial for creating sound even with coarse horsehair, is used by traditional archers to maintain the integrity of the string and (mixed with beeswax) to protect the finish of the bow. \n\n(From all this it is tempting to imagine the invention of the bow: the Mongol warrior, having just used rosin on his equipment, idly stroked his harp or lyre with a rosin-dusted finger and produced a brief continuous sound, which caused him to have an inspiration; whereupon he seized his bow, restrung it with horsehair, and so on. Obviously, the degree to which this fantasy is true will never be known.)\n\nHowever the bow was invented, it soon spread very widely. The Central Asian horse peoples occupied a territory that included the Silk Road, along which goods and innovations were transported rapidly for thousands of miles (including, via India, by sea to Java). This would account for the near-simultaneous appearance of the musical bow in the many locations cited by Halfpenny.\n\nThe modern Western bow",

    "question": "What colour is the bottom stripe on the U.S. flag?",
    "answer": "Red",
    "evidence": "\nFrancis Hopkinson of New Jersey, a naval flag designer, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, designed the 1777 flag  while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department, sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777. The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee.  Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag, but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy. Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work. These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.  In this letter, he asked for a \"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the Great Seal of the United States, and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \"great Naval Flag of the United States\" in the first bill; the \"Naval Flag of the United States\" in the second bill; and \"the Naval Flag of the States\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. By contrast, Hopkinson's flag for the United States had seven white stripes, and six red ones \u2013 in reality, six red stripes laid on a white background.  Hopkinson's sketches have not been found, but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty (naval) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time. His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes;  whereas, his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones. Hopkinson's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag. Remnants of Hopkinson's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President's seal. When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board, his position was like that of today's Secretary of the Navy.  The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress.   This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag, which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776.   Furthermore, a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10, 1779, documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army's use in battle. ",

    "question": "What is the name given to the largest bee in a hive?",
    "answer": "Queen",
    "evidence": "Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea, presently considered as a clade Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families,  though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher.  They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.\n\nSome species including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.\n\nBees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than 2 mm long, to Megachile pluto, the largest species of leafcutter bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 mm. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae, or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies.\nLater skep designs included a smaller woven basket (cap) on top over a small hole in the main skep.  This cap acted as a crude super, allowing the harvesting of some honey with less destruction of brood and bees. In England such an extension piece consisting of a ring of about 4 or 5 coils of straw placed below a straw beehive to give extra room for brood rearing was called an eke, imp or nadir. An eke was used to give just a bit of extra room, or to \"eke\" some more space, a nadir is a larger extension used when a full story was needed beneath.\n\nA person who made such woven beehives was called a \"skepper\", a surname that still exists in western countries. In England the thickness of the coil of straw was controlled using a ring of leather or piece of cows horn called a \"girth\" and the coils of straw could be sewn together using strips of briar. Likenesses of skeps can be found in paintings, carvings and old manuscripts. The skep is often used on signs as an indication of industry (\"the busy bee\").\n\nIn the late 18th century, more complex skeps appeared which had wooden tops with holes in them over which glass jars were placed. The comb was built in the glass jars which made it commercially attractive.\n\n \n\nIn the eastern United States, especially in the southeast, sections of hollow trees were used until the 20th century.  These were called \"gums\" because they often were from black gum (Nyssa sylvatica) trees. \n\nSections of the hollow trees were set upright in \"bee yards\" or apiaries. Sometimes sticks or crossed sticks were placed under a board cover to give an attachment for the honeycomb. As with skeps, harvest of honey from these destroyed the colony. Often the human bee \"robber\" would kill the bees before even opening their nest. This was done by inserting a metal container of burning sulfur into the gum.",

The defining characteristic of mead is that the majority of the beverage's fermentable sugar is derived from honey.\n\nDistilled beverages\n\nA distilled beverage or liquor is an alcoholic beverage produced by distilling (i.e., concentrating by distillation) ethanol produced by means of fermenting grain, fruit, or vegetables.  Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic beverages that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits.  For the most common distilled beverages, such as whiskey and vodka, the alcohol content is around 40%. The term hard liquor is used in North America to distinguish distilled beverages from undistilled ones (implicitly weaker). Vodka, gin, baijiu, tequila, whiskey, brandy, and soju are examples of distilled beverages. Distilling concentrates the alcohol and eliminates some of the congeners. Freeze distillation concentrates ethanol along with methanol and fusel alcohols (fermentation by-products partially removed by distillation) in applejack.\nIn 19th-century France, a mixture of coffee and spirits was called a gloria.\n* Un trait de son caract\u00e8re \u00e9tait de payer g\u00e9n\u00e9reusement quinze francs par mois pour le gloria qu'il prenait au dessert. (Balzac, Le P\u00e8re Goriot, 1834, I.)\n* Il aimait le gros cidre, les gigots saignants, les glorias longuement battus. (Flaubert, Madame Bovary, 1857.)\n\nPreparation\n\nBlack coffee is poured into the mug. Whiskey and at least one level teaspoon of sugar is stirred in until fully dissolved. The sugar is essential for floating liquid cream on top.  Thick cream is carefully poured over the back of a spoon initially held just above the surface of the coffee and gradually raised a little.  The layer of cream will float on the coffee without mixing. The coffee is drunk through the layer of cream.\n\nVariations\n\nIn 1988, the National Standards Authority of Ireland published Irish Standard I.S. 417: Irish Coffee.\n\nAlthough whiskey, coffee and cream are the basic ingredients in all Irish coffee, variations in preparation exist. The choice of coffee and the methods used for brewing it differ significantly. The use of espresso machines or fully automatic coffee brewers is now typical: the coffee is either a caff\u00e8 americano (espresso diluted with hot water) or some kind of filter coffee, often made using a coffee capsule.\n\nThe cream used by some bars to make what is sold as \"Irish coffee\" is sometimes sprayed from a can. Some bartenders gently shake fresh cream to achieve a smooth layer atop the coffee.\n\nIn Spain, Irish coffee (caf\u00e9 irland\u00e9s) is sometimes served with a bottom layer of whiskey, a separate coffee layer, and a layer of cream on top;  special devices are sold for making it.\n\nSome bars in Southeast Asia serve a cocktail of iced coffee and whiskey, sometimes without cream, under the name \"Irish coffee.\"",

As a Christian martyr, he later became one of the most venerated saints in Christianity.\n\nIn hagiography, as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and one of the most prominent military saints, he is immortalised in the myth of Saint George and the Dragon. His memorial, Saint George's Day, is traditionally celebrated on the Julian date of April 23 (currently May 6 according to the Gregorian calendar). Numerous countries, cities, professions and organisations claim Saint George as their patron.\n\nAccording to some sources his parents were Christians of the noble Roman family of the gens Anicia.  Other sources say his parents were Christians of Greek background; his father Gerontius ( Gerontios) was a Roman army official from Cappadocia, and his mother Polychronia was a Christian and a Greek native  from Lydda in the Roman province of Syria Palaestina (Palestine).

    "question": "Who is the Vice-President for George W Bush?",
    "answer": "Dick Cheyney",
    "evidence": "Some former vice presidents have sought other offices after serving as vice president. Daniel D. Tompkins ran for Governor of New York in 1820 whilst serving as vice president under James Monroe. He lost to DeWitt Clinton, but was re-elected vice president. John C. Calhoun resigned as vice president to accept election as US Senator from South Carolina. Hannibal Hamlin, Andrew Johnson, Alben Barkley and Hubert H. Humphrey were all elected to the Senate after leaving office. Levi P. Morton, vice president under Benjamin Harrison, was elected Governor of New York after leaving office.\n\nRichard Nixon unsuccessfully sought the governorship of California in 1962, nearly two years after leaving office as vice president and just over six years before becoming president. Walter Mondale ran unsuccessfully for president in 1984, served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan from 1993 to 1996, and then sought unsuccessfully to return to the Senate in 2002. George H. W. Bush won the presidency, and his vice president, Dan Quayle, sought the Republican nomination in 2000. Al Gore also ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 2000, turning to environmental advocacy afterward. Cheney had previously explored the possibility of running for president before serving as vice president, but chose not to run for president after his two terms as vice president.\n\nSince 1977, former presidents and vice presidents who are elected or re-elected to the Senate are entitled to the largely honorific position of Deputy President pro tempore. So far, the only former vice president to have held this title is Hubert Humphrey following his return to the Senate. Walter Mondale would have been entitled to the position had his 2002 Senate bid been successful.\nBush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas. Bush's campaign criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President Al Gore, over gun control and taxation. \n\nWhen the election returns came in on November 7, Bush won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in courts for a month until reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.  On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling,  the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision ordering a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he received 543,895 fewer individual votes than Gore nationwide, Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush was the first person to win an American presidential election with fewer national votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.\n\n2004 presidential candidacy\nPresident Bush is Honorary Chairman of Points of Light, an international nonprofit dedicated to engaging more people and resources in solving serious social problems through voluntary service. \n\nHis eldest son, George W. Bush, was inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States on January 20, 2001, and re-elected in 2004. Through previous administrations, the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as \"George Bush\" or \"President Bush\", but following his son's election the need to distinguish between them has made retronymic forms such as \"George H. W. Bush\" and \"George Bush senior\" and colloquialisms such as \"Bush 41\" and \"Bush the Elder\" much more common.\n\nPresidential library\n\nThe George Bush Presidential Library is the presidential library named for Bush. This tenth presidential library was built between 1995 and 1997 and contains the presidential and vice-presidential papers of Bush and the vice-presidential papers of Dan Quayle.  It was dedicated on November 6, 1997, and opened to the public shortly thereafter; the architectural firm of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum designed the complex.\n\nThe George Bush Presidential Library and Museum is located on a 90 acre site on the west campus of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, on a plaza adjoining the Presidential Conference Center and the Texas A&M Academic Center. The Library operates under NARA's administration and the [http://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/laws/1955-act.html Presidential Libraries Act of 1955]'s provisions.",

    "question": "Which film sees Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and Donald Sutherland as retired astronauts?",
    "answer": "Space Cowboys",
    "evidence": "1970s \n\nIn 1970, Eastwood starred with Shirley MacLaine in the western Two Mules for Sister Sara, directed by Don Siegel. The film follows an American mercenary, who gets mixed up with a prostitute disguised as a nun, and ends up helping a group of Juarista rebels during the reign of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico.   Eastwood once again played a mysterious stranger\u2014unshaven, wearing a serape-like vest, and smoking a cigar.  Although it received moderate reviews,    the film is listed in The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000\u00a0Movies Ever Made.  Later the same year, Eastwood starred as one of a group of Americans who steal a fortune in gold from the Nazis, in the World War II film Kelly's Heroes, with Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas. Kelly's Heroes was the last film Eastwood appeared in that was not produced by his own Malpaso Productions.  Filming commenced in July 1969 on location in Yugoslavia and in London.  The film received mostly a positive reception and its anti-war sentiments were recognized. In the winter of 1969\u201370, Eastwood and Siegel began planning his next film, The Beguiled, a tale of a wounded Union soldier, held captive by the sexually repressed matron (played by Geraldine Page) of a Southern girl's school.  Upon release the film received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwood's finest works by the French.  However, it grossed less than $1\u00a0million and, according to Eastwood and Lang, flopped due to poor publicity and the \"emasculated\" role of Eastwood.\nTommy Lee Jones (born September 15, 1946) is an American actor and filmmaker. He has received four Academy Award nominations, winning a Best Supporting Actor for his performance as U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard in the 1993 thriller film The Fugitive.\n\nHis other notable starring roles include former Texas Ranger Woodrow F. Call in the TV mini-series Lonesome Dove, Agent K in the Men in Black film series, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell in No Country for Old Men, the villain Two-Face in Batman Forever, terrorist William Strannix in Under Siege, a Texas Ranger in Man of the House, rancher Pete Perkins in The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, which he directed, Colonel Chester Phillips in Captain America: The First Avenger and Warden Dwight McClusky in Natural Born Killers. Jones has also portrayed real-life figures such as businessman Howard Hughes, Radical Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, executed murderer Gary Gilmore, U.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur, Oliver Lynn, husband of Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner's Daughter, and baseball great Ty Cobb.\n\nEarly life\n\nJones was born on September 15, 1946, in San Saba, Texas.   His mother, Lucille Marie (n\u00e9e Scott), was a police officer, school teacher, and beauty shop owner, and his father, Clyde C. Jones, was an oil field worker. The two were married and divorced twice. He was raised in Midland, Texas  and attended Robert E. Lee High School.\nFor the second half of the 1980s, Garner appeared in several of the North American market Mazda television commercials as an on-screen spokesman. \n\n1990s\n\nIn 1991, Garner starred in Man of the People, a television series about a con man chosen to fill an empty seat on a city council, with Kate Mulgrew and Corinne Bohrer.  Despite reasonably fair ratings, the show was canceled after only 10 episodes. In 1993, Garner played the lead in another well-received TV-movie, Barbarians at the Gate, and went on to reprise his role as Jim Rockford in eight The Rockford Files made-for-TV movies beginning the following year.   Practically everyone in the original cast of recurring characters returned for the new episodes except Noah Beery, Jr., who had died in the interim.\n\nIn 1994, Garner played Marshal Zane Cooper in a movie version of Maverick, with Mel Gibson as Bret Maverick (in the end it is revealed that Garner's character is the father of Gibson's Maverick) and Jodie Foster as a gambling lass with a fake Southern accent.  In 1995, he played lead character Woodrow Call, an ex-lawman, in the TV miniseries sequel to Lonesome Dove entitled Streets of Laredo, based on Larry McMurtry's book. In 1996, Garner and Jack Lemmon teamed up in My Fellow Americans, playing two former presidents who uncover scandalous activity by their successor (Dan Aykroyd) and are pursued by murderous NSA agents.  In addition to a major recurring role during the last part of the run of TV series Chicago Hope, Garner also starred in two short-lived series, the animated God, the Devil and Bob and First Monday, in which he played a Supreme Court justice.\n\nLater years\n\nIn 2000, after an operation to replace both knees,  Garner appeared with Clint Eastwood (who had played a villain in the original Maverick series) as astronauts in the movie Space Cowboys, also featuring Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland.",

The film is about a young man who receives a strange creature called a mogwai as a pet, which then spawns other creatures who transform into small, destructive, evil monsters. This story was continued with a sequel, Gremlins 2: The New Batch, released in 1990. Unlike the lighter sequel, Gremlins opts for more black comedy, balanced against a Christmastime setting. Both films were the center of large merchandising campaigns.\n\nSteven Spielberg was the film's executive producer and the screenplay was written by Chris Columbus. The film stars Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates, with Howie Mandel providing the voice of Gizmo, the main mogwai character. Gremlins was a commercial success and received positive reviews from critics. However, the film was also heavily criticized for some of its more violent sequences.

Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV, and finished in the beginning of the 15th century.;  The bridge replaced the old Judith Bridge built 1158\u20131172 that had been badly damaged by a flood in 1342. This new bridge was originally called the Stone Bridge (Kamenn\u00fd most) or the Prague Bridge (Pra\u017esk\u00fd most) but has been the \"Charles Bridge\" since 1870. As the only means of crossing the river Vltava (Moldau) until 1841, the Charles Bridge was the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city's Old Town and adjacent areas. This \"solid-land\" connection made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe.\n\nThe bridge is 621 m long and nearly 10 m wide, resting on 16 arches shielded by ice guards. It is protected by three bridge towers, two of them on the Lesser Quarter side and the third one on the Old Town side. The Old Town bridge tower is often considered to be one of the most astonishing civil gothic-style buildings in the world. The bridge is decorated by a continuous alley of 30 statues and statuaries, most of them baroque-style, originally erected around 1700 but now all replaced by replicas.\n\nHistory\n\nThrough the 19th century\nWenceslas Square (Czech: , colloquially V\u00e1clav\u00e1k)  is one of the main city squares and the centre of the business and cultural communities in the New Town of Prague, Czech Republic. Many historical events occurred there, and it is a traditional setting for demonstrations, celebrations, and other public gatherings. The square is named after Saint Wenceslas, the patron saint of Bohemia. It is part of the historic centre of Prague, a World Heritage Site. \n\nFormerly known as Ko\u0148sk\u00fd trh (Horse Market), for its periodic accommodation of horse markets during the Middle Ages, it was renamed Svatov\u00e1clavsk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed (English: Saint Wenceslas square) in 1848 on the proposal of Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd.\n\nFeatures\n\nLess a square than a boulevard, Wenceslas Square has the shape of a very long (750\u00a0m, total area 45,000\u00a0m2) rectangle, in a northwest\u2013southeast direction. The street slopes upward to the southeast side. At that end, the street is dominated by the grand neoclassical Czech National Museum. The northwest end runs up against the border between the New Town and the Old Town.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1348, Bohemian King Charles IV founded the New Town of Prague. The plan included several open areas for markets, of which the second largest was the Ko\u0148sk\u00fd trh, or Horse Market (the largest was the Charles Square ). At the southeastern end of the market was the Horse Gate, one of the gates in the walls of the New Town.\n\nDuring the Czech national revival movement in the 19th century, a more noble name for the street was requested. At this time the statue was built, and the square was renamed.\n\nOn 28 October 1918, Alois Jir\u00e1sek read the proclamation of independence of Czechoslovakia in front of the Saint Wenceslas statue.\n\nThe Nazis used the street for mass demonstrations.

During this trip the stormy relations between Jones and Pallenberg deteriorated to the point that Pallenberg left Morocco with Richards. Richards said later: \"That was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian. He'd never forgive me for that and I don't blame him, but hell, shit happens.\" Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band's first performances in Poland, Greece and Italy.\n\nOn 10 May 1967, the same day Jagger, Richards and Fraser were arraigned in connection with the Redlands charges\u2014Brian Jones' house was raided by police and he was arrested and charged with possession of cannabis. Three out of five Rolling Stones now faced drug charges. Jagger and Richards were tried at the end of June. On 29 June Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four amphetamine tablets; Richards was found guilty of allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to one year in prison. Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point, but were released on bail the next day pending appeal. The Times ran the famous editorial entitled \"Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?\" in which conservative editor William Rees-Mogg surprised his readers by his unusually critical discourse on the sentencing, pointing out that Jagger had been treated far more harshly for a minor first offence than \"any purely anonymous young man\".\nBecause of the song's length, some radio stations made edits to shorten it to 3 minutes, omitting the longer coda and the second instrumental section of the song.\n\nThere was speculation that the song was about David Bowie's first wife Angela,  the actress Angie Dickinson, Keith Richards' newborn daughter Dandelion Angela, and others. In 1993, in an interview for the liner notes to the Rolling Stones' compilation album Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones, Richards said that the title was inspired by his baby daughter.  However, in his 2010 memoir Life, Richards said that he had chosen the name at random when writing the song \u2014 before he knew that his baby would be named Angela or even knew that his baby would be a girl \u2014 and that the song \"was not about any particular person.\"  According to NME, Jagger's contributions to the lyrics referred to his breakup with Marianne Faithfull.\n\nThe Rolling Stones have frequently performed the song in concert; it was included in set lists on their 1973, 1975, and 1976 tours, and they have performed it on every tour since their 1982 European tour. Concert renditions were released on the albums Stripped and Live Licks.\n\nIn the documentary Protagonist, the former German terrorist Hans-Joachim Klein remarks that the song inspired him to adopt \"Angie\" as the moniker he used during his militant activities in the 1970s.

    "question": "Who bought Chelsea football club for \u00a31 in 1982?",
    "answer": "Ken Bates",
    "evidence": "In May 2007, Chelsea were the first team to win the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium, having also been the last to win it at the old Wembley.  They were the first English club to be ranked #1 under UEFA's five-year coefficient system in the 21st century.  They were the first team in Premier League history to score at least 100 goals in a single season, reaching the milestone on the final day of the 2009\u201310 season. Chelsea are the only London club to win the UEFA Champions League, after beating Bayern Munich in the 2012 final.  Upon winning the 2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League, Chelsea became the first English club to win all four European trophies and the only club to hold the Champions League and the Europa League at the same time. \n\nOwnership and finances\n\nChelsea Football Club were founded by Gus Mears in 1905. After his death in 1912, his descendents continued to own the club until 1982, when Ken Bates bought the club from Mears' great-nephew Brian Mears for \u00a31. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996.  In July 2003, Roman Abramovich purchased just over 50% of Chelsea Village plc's share capital, including Bates' 29.5% stake, for \u00a330\u00a0million and over the following weeks bought out most of the remaining 12,000 shareholders at 35 pence per share, completing a \u00a3140\u00a0million takeover. Other shareholders at the time of the takeover included the Matthew Harding estate (21%), BSkyB (9.9%) and various anonymous offshore trusts.  After passing the 90% share threshold, Abramovich took the club back into private hands, delisting it from the AIM on 22 August 2003. He also took on responsibility for the club's debt of \u00a380 million, quickly paying most of it.\nHe was involved with various other enterprises during the 1960s and 1970s, including projects on the British Virgin Islands and in Rhodesia.  The Leeds United fanzine Square Ball has published a photograph of Ken Bates with Rhodesian PM Ian Smith during a 1967 tour by Oldham Athletic, when Rhodesia was subject to UN sanctions.  Square Ball has reported, having worked with a documentary made in the British Virgin Islands,  that Bates attempted to purchase the island of Tortola on a 199-year lease, but was thwarted after protests by islanders caused the local government to change its decision and investigations began by the British government.    The original agreement to lease the island was known as the Bates-Hill Agreement.  Today, a park on Tortola is named after Noel Lloyd, a resident of the island who led the opposition to the agreement. \n\nIn 1976, he set up the Irish Trust Bank. but it was eventually wound up leaving thousands of investors out-of-pocket. \n\nOldham and Wigan\n\nAfter having been chairman of Oldham Athletic for five years in the 1960s, in 1980 Bates became co-owner and Vice Chairman of Wigan Athletic with his old business associate Feddie Pye. He provided significant finance by way of bank guarantees that enabled the then manager, Larry Lloyd, to sign a number of players, not the least of which was Eamonn O'Keefe from Everton for \u00a365,000. The Latics duly gained promotion under Lloyd to the Third Division in May 1982.\n\nChelsea F.C.",

Allegory communicates its message by means of symbolic figures, actions or symbolic representation. Allegory is generally treated as a figure of rhetoric, but an allegory does not have to be expressed in language: it may be addressed to the eye, and is often found in realistic painting. An example of a simple visual allegory is the image of the grim reaper. Viewers understand that the image of the grim reaper is a symbolic representation of death.\n\nBodeg\u00f3n\n\nIn Spanish art, a bodeg\u00f3n is a still life painting depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often arranged on a simple stone slab, and also a painting with one or more figures, but significant still life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. Starting in the Baroque period, such paintings became popular in Spain in the second quarter of the 17th century. The tradition of still life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary Low Countries, today Belgium and Netherlands (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in southern Europe. Northern still lifes had many subgenres: the breakfast piece was augmented by the trompe-l'\u0153il, the flower bouquet, and the vanitas. In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of breakfast piece did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table.\n\nBody painting\nVincent Willem van Gogh (; 30 March 1853 - 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter whose work had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. He was highly prolific and often completed more than one painting per day. In just over a decade he created approximately 2100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by symbolic colours and dramatic, impulsive, highly expressive paintwork. He sold only one painting during his lifetime and was largely unnoticed by critics until his suicide, aged 37, which followed years of poverty and mental illness.\n\nBorn into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh was thoughtful and intellectual as a child, but showed signs of mental instability. He worked as an art dealer as a young man, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, spending time as a missionary in southern Belgium, and later drifting in ill-health and solitude. He was keenly aware of modernist trends in art, and after moving back home with his parents, took up painting in 1881 with the financial support of his younger brother Theo, who kept up a long correspondence of letters with him. Many of his early works depict common and peasant labourers, and contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his mature period when he broadened his subject matter to include olive trees, cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers. In 1886 he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. From then his paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in 1888. There he lived in the \"Yellow House\", and with the French artist Paul Gauguin developed a concept of colour that symbolised inner emotion.",

In a format change from the previous tournament in 1983, the entered teams were placed in one large group, with the group winner taking the gold medal. In their opening match, American Samoa were on the receiving end of a 10\u20130 thrashing from the hosts, New Caledonia. Their next two matches also ended in defeat, albeit less severe: 7\u20130 against Vanuatu and 5\u20131 against the Wallis and Futuna Islands. Papua New Guinea, however, were less merciful, and scored twenty without reply in what turned out to be the American Samoans' last game of the tournament, their final match against Tahiti being cancelled. American Samoa would not enter again until 2007, missing the 1991, 1995, and 2003 tournaments.\n\n2007\n\nAmerican Samoa made their 3rd appearance at the South Pacific Games football tournament in 2007. The competition also doubled as the first stage of the OFC qualification tournament for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with the three medal winners progressing to the final qualifying group. American Samoa were drawn in Group B along with the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu. In their opening match, they were defeated 12\u20131 by the Solomon Islands, with Ramin Ott scoring only their second goal in their FIFA World Cup qualification history. Following two more heavy defeats (7\u20130 against Samoa and 15\u20130 against Vanuatu), American Samoa went into their final game versus Tonga unable to qualify from their group. Their 4\u20130 defeat in this game, however, was their best result since 2006.\n\n2011\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup was the 17th staging of the FIFA World Cup which took place from 31 May to 30 June 2002 in South Korea and Japan.

Brazil won the tournament for a record fifth time, winning the final against Germany 2\u20130.  The victory meant Brazil qualified for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup for the fifth time, representing the World. In the third place play-off match against South Korea, Turkey won 3\u20132 taking third place in their only second ever FIFA World Cup finals.  China PR, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia made their first appearances at the finals with Turkey making its first appearance since 1954.\n\nThe tournament had several upsets and surprise results which included the defending champions France being eliminated in the group stage after earning a single point and second favourites Argentina also being eliminated in the group stage. Additionally, Turkey surprisingly took third place and South Korea managed to reach the semi-finals, beating Spain, Italy and Portugal en route. Another big shock came in the opening match of the tournament when underdog debutantes Senegal defeated defending champions France, going on to reach the quarter-finals only to be beaten by Turkey.

    "evidence": "For mammals the gestation period is the time in which a fetus develops, beginning with fertilization and ending at birth.  The duration of this period varies between species.\n\nDuration\n\nFor most species, the amount a fetus grows before birth determines the length of the gestation period. Smaller species normally have a shorter gestation period than larger animals. For example, a cat's gestation normally takes 58\u201365 days while an elephant's takes nearly 2 years (21 months).  However, growth does not necessarily determine the length of gestation for all species, especially for those with a breeding season. Species that use a breeding season usually give birth during a specific time of year when food is available.\n\nVarious other factors can come into play in determining the duration of gestation. For humans, male fetuses normally gestate several days longer than females and multiple pregnancies gestate for a shorter period. Ethnicity may also lengthen or shorten gestation.  In dogs there's a positive correlation between gestation time and a small litter size.\n\nGestational periods",

    "question": "What name is given to the home of a beaver?",

    "evidence": "The beaver (genus Castor) is a primarily nocturnal, large, semiaquatic rodent. Castor includes two extant species, the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) (native to North America) and Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) (Eurasia). Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the capybara). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6\u201312 million. This population decline is the result of extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because the beavers' harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses. \n\nGeneral\n\nBeavers, along with pocket gophers and kangaroo rats, are castorimorph rodents, a suborder of rodents mostly restricted to North America. Although just two closely related species exist today, beavers have a long fossil history in the Northern Hemisphere beginning in the Eocene, and many species of giant beaver existed until quite recently, such as Trogontherium in Europe, and Castoroides in North America.\n\nBeavers are known for their natural trait of building dams on rivers and streams, and building their homes (known as \"lodges\") in the resulting pond. Beavers also build canals to float building materials that are difficult to haul over land.  They use powerful front teeth to cut trees and other plants that they use both for building and for food. In the absence of existing ponds, beavers must construct dams before building their lodges. First they place vertical poles, then fill between the poles with a crisscross of horizontally placed branches. They fill in the gaps between the branches with a combination of weeds and mud until the dam impounds sufficient water to surround the lodge.",

    "question": "What name is given to a baby marsupial?",
    "answer": "Joey",
    "evidence": "Early development\n\nAn early birth removes a developing marsupial from its mother's body much sooner than in placental mammals, thus marsupials have not developed a complex placenta to protect the embryo from its mother's immune system. Though early birth puts the tiny newborn marsupial at a greater environmental risk, it significantly reduces the dangers associated with long pregnancies, as there is no need to carry a large fetus to full-term in bad seasons. Marsupials are extremely altricial animals, needing to be intensely cared for immediately following birth (cf. precocial).\n\nBecause newborn marsupials must climb up to their mother's nipples, their front limbs are much more developed than the rest of their bodies at the time of birth. This requirement has been argued to have resulted in the limited range of locomotor adaptations in marsupials compared to placentals. Marsupials must develop grasping forepaws during their early youth, making the transition from these limbs into hooves, wings, or flippers, as some groups of placental mammals have done, far more difficult. However, several marsupials do possess atypical forelimb morphologies, such as the hooved forelimbs of the pig-footed bandicoot, suggesting that the range of forelimb speciation is a lot less limited than usually assumed. \n\nAn infant marsupial is known as a joey. Marsupials have a very short gestation period (about four to five weeks), and the joey is born in an essentially fetal state. The blind, furless, miniature newborn, the size of a jelly bean,  crawls across its mother's fur to make its way into the pouch, where it latches onto a teat for food. It will not re-emerge for several months, during which time it develops fully. After this period, the joey begins to spend increasing lengths of time out of the pouch, feeding and learning survival skills. However, it returns to the pouch to sleep, and if danger threatens, it will seek refuge in its mother's pouch for safety.",

    "question": "Author Dick Francis is famous for writing novels based around which sport?",
    "answer": "Horseracing",
    "evidence": "Richard Stanley \"Dick\" Francis CBE FRSL (31 October 1920 \u2013 14 February 2010) was a British  steeplechase jockey and crime writer, whose novels centre on horse racing in England.   \n\nAfter wartime service in the RAF, Francis became a full-time jump-jockey, winning over 350 races and becoming champion jockey of the British National Hunt. He came to further prominence in 1956 as jockey to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, riding her horse Devon Loch when it fell, for unexplained reasons, while close to winning the Grand National. He then retired from the turf and became a professional journalist and novelist.\n\nAll his novels deal with crime in the horse-racing world, some of the criminals being outwardly respectable figures. The stories are narrated by one of the key players, often a jockey, but sometimes a trainer, an owner, a bookie, or someone in a different profession, peripherally linked to racing. This person is always facing great obstacles, often including physical injury, from which he must fight back with determination. More than forty of these novels became international best-sellers.\n\nPersonal life \n\nFrancis was born in Coedcanlas, Pembrokeshire, Wales. Some sources report his birthplace as the inland town of Lawrenny, but at least two of his obituaries stated his birthplace as the coastal town of Tenby.   His autobiography says that he was born at his maternal grandparents' farm at Coedcanlas on the estuary of the River Cleddau,  roughly a mile north-west of Lawrenny. He was the son of a jockey and stable manager  and he grew up in Berkshire, England.  He left school at 15 without any qualifications,  with the intention of becoming a jockey and became a trainer in 1938.",

    "question": "Which Scottish newspaper features the Broons and Oor Wullie?",
    "answer": "The Sunday Post",
    "evidence": "The Broons is a comic strip in Scots published in the weekly Scottish newspaper, The Sunday Post. It features the Brown family, who live in a tenement flat at 10 Glebe Street, in (since the late 1990s) the fictional Scottish town of Auchentogle or Auchenshoogle.\n\nOriginally created by writer/editor R. D. Low and artist Dudley D. Watkins, the strip made its first appearance in the issue dated 8 March 1936.[http://web.archive.org/web/20110515024416/http://www.thatsbraw.co.uk/ That's Braw!]\n\nSince its inception, The Broons have had their own biennial, alternating each year with Oor Wullie. No annuals were published during 1943 and 1945 due to paper rationing in World War II.\n\nCharacters\nOor Wullie is a Scottish comic strip published in the D.C. Thomson newspaper The Sunday Post. It features a character called Wullie, the familiar Scots nickname for boys named William. Oor Wullie means Our Willie. His trademarks are spiky hair, dungarees and an upturned bucket, which he often uses as a seat - most strips since early 1937 begin and end with a single panel of Wullie sitting on his bucket. The earliest strips, with little dialogue, ended with Wullie complaining (\"I nivver get ony fun roond here!\"). The artistic style settled down by 1940 and has changed little since. A frequent tagline reads, \"Oor Wullie! Your Wullie! A'body's Wullie!\" (Our Willie! Your Willie! Everybody's Willie!).\n\nCreated by Thomson editor R. D. Low and drawn by cartoonist Dudley D. Watkins, the strip first appeared on 8 March 1936. Watkins continued to draw Oor Wullie until his death in 1969, after which the Post recycled his work into the 1970s. New strips were eventually commissioned from Tom Lavery, followed by Peter Davidson and Robert Nixon. Ken H. Harrison drew the strip from 1989 until 1997, when Davidson resumed duties. Between January 2005 and 2006 storylines were written by broadcaster Tom Morton from his home in Shetland,  and subsequently they were written by Dave Donaldson, managing director of Thomson's comics division.   The current writer is former Dandy editor Morris Heggie.\n\nCharacters and story \n\nThough it has been claimed on the internet that Wullie's full name is William MacCallum, this name - or any surname at all - has never appeared in any of the strips in The Sunday Post. While his home town was unnamed in the original Watkins strips, it has been called Auchenshoogle since the late 1990s.",

They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fourteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young to join them. After a month of Harrison's persistence, they enlisted him as their lead guitarist. By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had recently sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used the name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had changed their name to the Silver Beatles and by the middle of August to the Beatles.",

    "question": "The Kray twins were convicted of the murder of George Cornell in the East End of London in 1966. What was the name of the pub in which he was shot?",
    "answer": "The Blind Beggar",
    "evidence": "Frank Mitchell\n\nOn 12 December 1966, the Krays helped Frank Mitchell, \"the Mad Axeman\",  to escape from Dartmoor Prison. Ronnie had befriended Mitchell while they served time together in Wandsworth prison. Mitchell felt that the authorities should review his case for parole, so Ronnie thought that he would be doing him a favour by getting him out of Dartmoor, highlighting his case in the media and forcing the authorities to act.\n\nOnce Mitchell was out of Dartmoor, the Krays held him at a friend's flat in Barking Road, East Ham. He was a large man with a mental disorder, and he was difficult to control. He disappeared, but the Krays were acquitted of his murder. Freddie Foreman, a former member of the Firm, claimed in his autobiography Respect that he shot Mitchell and disposed of his body at sea.\n\nGeorge Cornell\n\nRonnie Kray shot and killed George Cornell, an associate of the Richardsons, leaders of a rival gang. The killing occurred at the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel on 9 March 1966. Ronnie was drinking in another pub when he learned of Cornell's location. He went there with his brother's driver John Dickson and his assistant Ian Barrie but killed Cornell alone. Just before he died, Cornell remarked, \"Well, look who's here.\"\n\nThere are differing motives offered for the murder: \nCornell's position as a leader of an opposing gang\nHe was threatening the Krays\nHe had previously insulted Kray\nHe was thought to have a part in the murder of Ronnie's former associate Richard Hart \nRonnie Kray was already suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the killing.\nGeorge Cornell (born George Myers;  \u2013 9 March 1966) was an English criminal and member of the Richardson Gang, who were scrap metal dealers and criminals. He was shot and killed by Ronnie Kray at the Blind Beggar public house in Whitechapel, east London. Kray was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder three years later and remained in Broadmoor Hospital until his death in 1995.\n\nHistory\n\nCornell hailed from east London and was originally known as George Myers but had changed his surname some years earlier. Cornell was a tough, loyal enforcer who worked for the Richardson Gang; he was known for being totally fearless. A childhood friend of the Kray twins, Cornell was a prominent criminal in east London during the 1960s and upon moving to South London joined up with the Kray twins' rivals, the Richardson Gang, who were brothers Charlie Richardson and Eddie Richardson.   \n\nCornell, along with Richardson gang colleague and friend \"Mad\" Frankie Fraser,  became an enforcer for the Richardsons and was primarily used by them for talks with the Krays. Meetings were often held in pubs such as The Grave Maurice. \n\nDeath\n\nOn 9 March 1966, Cornell and his friend Albie Woods entered the Blind Beggar pub, ordered some light ales and then sat upon stools next to the bar. At around 8:30pm, both men were approached by Ronnie Kray; on seeing him, Cornell sneered with sarcasm \"Look who's here\". Ronnie Kray walked towards Cornell, took out a 9\u00a0mm Luger, and calmly shot him once in the forehead, just above his right eye. \n\nCornell slumped against a nearby pillar, the bullet, apparently, passing straight through him. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died at around 03:30am. \n\nThe news spread rapidly. Although Ronnie Kray was identified by several eyewitnesses as he calmly left the public house, no one would agree to testify against him and the police were forced to release him from custody. Cornell was buried in Camberwell New Cemetery, south London. \n\nOld Bailey trial",

    "question": "Who composed the musical theme for the Pink Panther?",
    "answer": "Henry Mancini",
    "evidence": "The Pink Panther is a series of comedy films featuring an inept French police detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The series began with the release of The Pink Panther (1963). The role of Clouseau was originated by, and is most closely associated with, Peter Sellers. Most of the films were directed and co-written by Blake Edwards, with theme music composed by Henry Mancini.\n\nIn the films, the Pink Panther is a large and valuable  pink diamond which is first shown in the opening film in the series. The diamond is called the \"Pink Panther\" because the flaw at its center, when viewed closely, is said to resemble a leaping pink panther. The phrase reappears in the title of the fourth film The Return of the Pink Panther, in which the theft of the diamond is again the center of the plot. The phrase was used for all the subsequent films in the series, even when the jewel did not figure in the plot. It ultimately appeared in six of the eleven films.\n\nThe first film in the series had an animated opening sequence, created by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises and set to the theme music by Mancini, which featured the Pink Panther character. This character, designed by Hawley Pratt and Friz Freleng, was subsequently the subject of its own series of animated cartoons which gained its highest profile when aired on Saturday mornings as The Pink Panther Show. The character would be featured in the opening of every film in the movie series except A Shot in the Dark and Inspector Clouseau.\n\nDevelopment \n\nAlthough there are two later Pink Panther films starring Steve Martin, most of the films in the series starred Sellers as Inspector Clouseau and were directed and co-written by Blake Edwards. The jazz-based theme music was composed by Henry Mancini. In addition to the credits sequences, the theme often accompanies any suspenseful sequence in the first film and in subsequent films using the character.\n\"The Pink Panther Theme\" is an instrumental composition by Henry Mancini written as the theme for the 1963 film The Pink Panther and subsequently nominated for the 1964 Academy Award for Best Original Score. The eponymous cartoon character created for the film's opening credits by David DePatie and Friz Freleng was animated in time to the tune. The tenor saxophone solo was played by Plas Johnson.\n\nThe tune was included on the film's soundtrack album and issued as a single (in the United States) in 1964; the single reached the Top 10 on the U.S. Billboard adult contemporary chart and won three Grammy Awards.\n\nVarious recordings of the tune were featured in the opening credits of all The Pink Panther films, with the exception of A Shot in the Dark and Inspector Clouseau. It has also been used in countless works featuring the animated Pink Panther character. \n\n\"The Pink Panther Theme\", originally played in the key of E minor, is noted for its quirky, unusual use of chromaticism which is derived from the Hungarian minor scale (gypsy/romani scale ) with raised 4th and 7th degrees.\n\nOther versions\n\nIn the 1978 film Revenge of the Pink Panther, the theme, and much of the soundtrack from this entry in the series, draw heavily from the disco sound of the late 1970s. The theme itself was reworked to include a more dancy bassline, electric piano, and guitar solo. A similar thing was done for 1983's Curse of the Pink Panther, where it had more electronic sounds incorporated.\n\nThe theme was used in John McLaughlin and Al Di Meola's live version of Chick Corea's Short Tales of the Black Forest, from the 1981 album Friday Night in San Francisco. \n\nIn the 1993 film Son of the Pink Panther, the theme was rearranged and performed by Bobby McFerrin in the opening titles. This version was unique in being the only one to be performed a cappella.",

    "question": "During Margaret Thatcher's years as Prime Minister, there were three Chancellors of the Exchequer. Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson were two, but who was the other one?",
    "answer": "John Major",
    "evidence": "On 2 April 1982 the ruling military junta in Argentina ordered the invasion of the British-controlled Falkland Islands and South Georgia, triggering the Falklands War. The subsequent crisis was \"a defining moment of her [Thatcher's] premiership\". At the suggestion of Harold Macmillan and Robert Armstrong, she set up and chaired a small War Cabinet (formally called ODSA, Overseas and Defence committee, South Atlantic) to take charge of the conduct of the war,  which by 5\u20136 April had authorised and dispatched a naval task force to retake the islands. Argentina surrendered on 14 June and the operation was hailed a success, notwithstanding the deaths of 255\u00a0British servicemen and 3\u00a0Falkland Islanders. Argentinian deaths totalled 649, half of them after the nuclear-powered submarine  torpedoed and sank the cruiser ARA General Belgrano on 2 May. Thatcher was criticised for the neglect of the Falklands' defence that led to the war, and especially by Tam Dalyell in parliament for the decision to sink the General Belgrano, but overall she was considered a highly capable and committed war leader. The \"Falklands factor\", an economic recovery beginning early in 1982, and a bitterly divided opposition all contributed to Thatcher's second election victory in 1983.  Thatcher often referred after the war to the \"Falklands Spirit\"; Hastings and Jenkins (1983) suggested that this reflected her preference for the streamlined decision-making of her War Cabinet over the painstaking deal-making of peace-time cabinet government.\nIt has also been common for Prime Ministers to be granted a peerage upon retirement from the Commons, which elevates the individual to the House of Lords. Formerly, the peerage bestowed was usually an earldom (which was always hereditary), with Churchill offered a dukedom.  However, since the 1960s, hereditary peerages have generally been eschewed, and life peerages have been preferred, although in 1984 Harold Macmillan was created Earl of Stockton. Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher accepted life peerages, although Douglas-Home had previously disclaimed his hereditary title as Earl of Home. Edward Heath, John Major and Tony Blair did not accept peerages of any kind, although Heath and Major were later appointed as Knights of the Garter. Gordon Brown remained a member of parliament until the 2015 general election, and has not, to date, accepted a peerage.\n\nLiving former Prime Ministers\n\nAs of , there are four living former Prime Ministers, as seen below.\n\nFile:JMajor.JPG|Sir John Majorserved 1990\u201397born 1943 (age )\nFile:WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM ANNUAL MEETING 2009 - Tony Blair.jpg|Tony Blairserved 1997\u20132007born 1953 (age )\nFile:Accelerating Infrastructure Development Gordon Brown (8412051140).jpg|Gordon Brownserved 2007\u201310born 1951 (age )\nFile:Prime Minister David Cameron (5570842655).jpg|David Cameron MPserved 2010\u201316born 1966 (age )\nHowe was closely involved in the negotiations leading up to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong, and developed a good working relationship with the U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, mirroring the close connection between Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan.  However Howe's tenure was made difficult by growing behind-the-scenes tensions with the Prime Minister on a number of issues, first on South Africa, next on Britain's relations with the European Community, and then in 1985 the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  For his staff, Howe was a respected boss; mild-mannered, polite and courteous, he was assiduous in his attention to detail.  However the human rights questions over South African sanctions and trade embargo coupled to his deep concern over Thatcher's strident style in Europe, increasingly drove a stressful wedge between Nos 10 and 11.  On policy objectives they began to drift apart with fatal consequences for the Prime Minister's ambitions. Thatcher's dominant style contrasted with his emollience, patience and capacity for negotiation.  Their differences were dated to the Westland Affair in 1986, when senior ministers almost forced her to resign, instead of Michael Heseltine, according to Douglas Hurd's memoirs.\n\nIn June 1989, Howe and his successor as Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, both secretly threatened to resign over Thatcher's opposition to British proposed membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. She turned increasingly for advice to her No.10 private secretary Charles Powell, a career diplomat who contrasted to Howe's mandarin-style.  Howe remarked, \"She was often exasperated by my tenaciously quiet brand of advocacy.\"   His friends often wondered why he put up with her style for so long; but many considered him to be her successor. One historian has suggested that the government would have survived even the ructions over Europe had Howe remained her ally. \n\nDeputy Prime Minister",

    "question": "Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper were two of the three musicians who died in a plane crash in February 1959. Who was the other one?",
    "answer": "Richie Valens",
    "evidence": "The Winter Dance Party tour began in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel involved created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences.  Holly's drummer Carl Bunch was hospitalized for frostbite to his toes (suffered while aboard the bus), so Holly decided to seek other transportation. Before their appearance in Clear Lake, Iowa, on Feb 2, Holly chartered a four-seat Beechcraft Bonanza airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, Iowa, for Jennings, Allsup, and himself. Holly's idea was to depart following the show at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue, in Moorhead, Minnesota, via Fargo, North Dakota, allowing them time to rest and launder their clothes and avoid a rigorous bus journey. Immediately after the Clear Lake show (which ended just before midnight), Allsup lost a coin toss and gave up his seat on the plane to Ritchie Valens, while Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson (the Big Bopper), who had influenza and complained that the tour bus was too cold and uncomfortable for a man of his size. \n\nThe pilot, Roger Peterson, took off in inclement weather, although he was not certified to fly by instruments only. Shortly after 1:00\u00a0am on February 3, 1959, Holly, Valens, Richardson, and Peterson were killed instantly when their plane crashed at full throttle into a cornfield outside Mason City, Iowa, soon after take-off. The bodies of the entertainers were all ejected from the plane on impact, while Peterson's body remained entangled in the wreckage. Holly sustained fatal trauma to his head and chest and numerous lacerations and fractures of his arms and legs.\nJiles Perry \"J. P.\" Richardson, Jr. (October 24, 1930 \u2013 February 3, 1959), commonly known as The Big Bopper, was an American musician, songwriter, and disc jockey, whose big rockabilly look, style, voice, and exuberant personality made him an early rock and roll star. He is best known for his 1958 recording of \"Chantilly Lace\".\n\nOn February 3, 1959, Richardson died in a plane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa, along with music stars Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens, and pilot Roger Peterson.\n\nThe accident was famously eulogized as \"The Day the Music Died\" in Don McLean's 1971 song \"American Pie\".\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\nJ. P. Richardson was born in Sabine Pass, Texas, the oldest son of oil-field worker Jiles Perry Richardson, Sr. and his wife Elise (Stalsby) Richardson. Richardson had two younger brothers, Cecil and James. The family soon moved to Beaumont, Texas. Richardson graduated from Beaumont High School in 1947 and played on the \"Royal Purple\" football team as a defensive lineman, wearing number 85.  Richardson later studied prelaw at Lamar College, and was a member of the band and chorus.\n\nRadio\n\nRichardson worked part-time at Beaumont, Texas, radio station KTRM (now KZZB). He was hired by the station full-time in 1949 and quit college. Richardson married Adrianne Joy Fryou on April 18, 1952, and their daughter Debra Joy was born in December 1953, soon after Richardson was promoted to supervisor of announcers at KTRM.\n\nIn March 1955, he was drafted into the United States Army and did his basic training at Fort Ord, California. He spent the rest of his two-year service as a radar instructor at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.\nOn February 3, 1959, rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson were killed in a plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa, together with the pilot, Roger Peterson. The event later became known as \"The Day the Music Died\", after singer-songwriter Don McLean so referred to it in his 1971 song \"American Pie\".\n\nAt the time, Holly and his band, consisting of Waylon Jennings, Tommy Allsup, and Carl Bunch, were playing on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour across the Midwest. Rising artists Valens and Richardson had joined the tour as well.\n\nThe long journeys between venues on board the cold, uncomfortable tour buses adversely affected the performers, with cases of flu and even frostbite. After stopping at Clear Lake to perform, and frustrated by such conditions, Holly decided to charter a plane to reach their next venue in Moorhead, Minnesota. Richardson, who had flu, swapped places with Jennings taking the latter's seat on the plane, while  Allsup lost his seat to Valens on a coin toss.\n\nSoon after take-off, late at night and in poor, wintry weather conditions, the pilot lost control of the light aircraft, a Beechcraft Bonanza, which subsequently crashed into a cornfield, leaving no survivors.\n\nBackground\n\nBuddy Holly terminated his association with the Crickets in November 1958. For the start of the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour, he assembled a band consisting of Waylon Jennings (bass), Tommy Allsup (guitar), and Carl Bunch (drums), and the opening vocals of Frankie Sardo. The tour was set to cover 24 Midwestern cities in as many days. New hit artist Ritchie Valens, J. P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson and Dion DiMucci (of Dion and the Belmonts fame) joined the tour to promote their recordings and make an extra profit.",

    "question": "Apart from being warm blooded and giving birth to live young, what do mammals produce to differentiate them from other families of animals?",
    "answer": "Milk",
    "evidence": "Viviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria; those living today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located in the front of the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy. Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way.  The placentals are unusual among mammals in giving birth to complete and fully developed young, usually after long gestation periods. \n\nEndothermy\n\nNearly all mammals are endothermic (\"warm-blooded\"). Most mammals also have hair to help keep them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for nonavian reptiles and large insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles.  Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm.  Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy is not unique to mammals. \n\nBehavior\n\nFeeding",

The film was originally released in the US as The Postman, a straight translation of the Italian title.   However, since the release of Kevin Costner's post-apocalyptic film of the same name, the film has gone by the title Il Postino: The Postman.\n\nThe film tells a fictional story in which the real life Chilean poet Pablo Neruda forms a relationship with a simple postman who learns to love poetry. It stars Philippe Noiret, Massimo Troisi, and Maria Grazia Cucinotta. The screenplay was adapted by Anna Pavignano, Michael Radford, Furio Scarpelli, Giacomo Scarpelli, and Massimo Troisi from the novel Ardiente paciencia by Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta. In 1983, Sk\u00e1rmeta himself wrote and directed the film Ardiente paciencia (English translation: \"Burning Patience\"), which he later adapted to the novel of the same name in 1985.\n\nWriter/star Massimo Troisi postponed heart surgery so that he could complete the film. The day after filming was completed, he suffered a fatal heart attack. \n\nPlot \n\nSet in the year 1950, Pablo Neruda, the famous Chilean poet, is exiled to a small island in Italy for political reasons. His wife accompanies him. On the island, a local, Mario Ruoppolo, is dissatisfied with being a fisherman, like his father. Mario looks for other work and is hired as a temporary postman, with Neruda as his only customer. He uses his bicycle to hand deliver Neruda's mail (the island has no cars). Though poorly educated, the postman eventually befriends Neruda and becomes further influenced by Neruda's political views and poetry.",

    "evidence": "Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century is a compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people, published in Time magazine in 1999.\n\nThe idea for such a list started on February 1, 1998, with a debate at a symposium in Hanoi, Vietnam. The panel participants were former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, former New York governor Mario Cuomo, then\u2013Stanford Provost Condoleezza Rice, publisher Irving Kristol, and Time managing editor Walter Isaacson.\n\nIn a separate issue on December 31, 1999, Time recognized Einstein as the Person of the Century.\n\nList categories\n\nTime's article cites twenty persons in each of five broad categories: Leaders and Revolutionaries, Scientists and Thinkers, Builders and Titans, Artists and Entertainers, and Heroes and Icons.\n\nPerson of the Century\n\nOf the 100 chosen, Albert Einstein was chosen as the Person of the Century, on the grounds that he was the preeminent scientist in a century dominated by science. The editors of Time believed the 20th century \"will be remembered foremost for its science and technology\", and Einstein \"serves as a symbol of all the scientists\u2014such as Heisenberg, Bohr, Richard Feynman, ...who built upon his work\". \n\nThe cover of the magazine featured the famous image of Einstein taken in 1947 by American portrait photographer Philippe Halsman.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nFile:FDR in 1933.jpg|Franklin D.

She was named one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, an honor shared with Albert Einstein, Mohandas Karamchand (Mahatma) Gandhi, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. She was only one of four people who were included on these lists in both the 20th and 21st century. The others included Mandela, Gates, and Pope John Paul II....\nThe scope of Winfrey\u2019s influence creates a unique opportunity to examine the effect of endorsements on political outcomes.\n\nThe economists found a statistically significant correlation between the number of Winfrey fans in a geographic region (as estimated by magazine sales and book club selections) and the number of votes Obama received in that region during the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. They found that the correlation even held up when they controlled for all kinds of confounding variables like race, gender, income, education, and sales of other magazines. They further found that the correlation only emerged after Winfrey had endorsed Obama, suggesting that it was the influence of her endorsement that caused the correlation. When they statistically removed the correlation to see how Obama would have performed without Winfrey's endorsement, they found that over one million votes vanished from Obama\u2019s total in the Democratic primary and that Clinton received far more votes.",

A rugged, uncompromising defender, he soon became popular with the Southampton fans especially after confidently tucking away a penalty against Newcastle United on 1 April in only his sixth game for the club, thus helping the \"Saints\" earn their first victory in 18 matches and start Southampton on a climb away from the relegation zone. His goal celebration after the 89th-minute penalty became known as the \"Ruddock stomp\".

    "evidence": "Rooney scored his first goal of the 2003\u201304 season in a 2\u20132 away draw against Charlton Athletic on 26 August 2003.  He did not find the net again until December when he scored in a 2\u20131 away win over Portsmouth,  and a 3\u20132 home win over Leicester City.  His final goal of 2003 came on his 50th league appearance, netting the only goal in a 1\u20130 home win over Birmingham City on 28 December.  On 21 February 2004, Rooney scored two goals in a Premier League game for the first time in a 3\u20133 away draw against Southampton.  He scored the sole goal in a 1\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 13 March,  before scoring in a 1\u20131 away draw against Leicester City one week later.  He scored his final goal of the season in a 1\u20131 away draw against Leeds United on 13 April. \n\nManchester United \n\n2004\u201305 season \n\nRooney made a transfer request in August 2004, despite Everton having made a new contract offer valued at \u00a350,000 per week.  Everton then rejected a bid of \u00a320\u00a0million from Newcastle,  and ultimately signed for Manchester United at the end of the month after a \u00a325.6\u00a0million deal was reached.  It was the highest fee ever paid for a player under 20 years old; Rooney was still only 18 when he left Everton.  Sir Alex Ferguson, then manager of United, said that \"There were plenty of eyebrows raised\" when he persuaded the club's board of directors to sanction \"a multi-million pound\" move to try to sign Rooney from Everton.\nManchester United won the league again in the 1999\u20132000 and 2000\u201301 seasons. The team finished third in 2001\u201302, before regaining the title in 2002\u201303.  They won the 2003\u201304 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3\u20130 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.  In the 2005\u201306 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade,  but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup Final. The club regained the Premier League in the 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308 seasons, and completed the European double by beating Chelsea 6\u20135 on penalties in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in this game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton.  In December 2008, the club won the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup and followed this with the 2008\u201309 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title.   That summer, Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record \u00a380\u00a0million.

Luton Town, Notts County and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old first division at the end of the 1991\u201392 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season.\n\n\"Big Four\" dominance (2000s) \n\nOne significant feature of the Premier League in the mid-2000s was the dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United.  During this decade, and particularly from 2002 to 2009, they dominated the top four spots, which came with UEFA Champions League qualification, taking all top four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003\u201304 to 2008\u201309 inclusive, with Arsenal going as far as winning the league without losing a single game in 2003\u201304, the only time it has ever happened in the Premier League.  In May 2008 Kevin Keegan stated that \"Big Four\" dominance threatened the division, \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\"  Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"",

    "question": "The Yalu river forms a sort of natural border between China and which of its neighbours?",
    "answer": "North Korea",
    "evidence": "The Yalu River, also called the Amnok River, is a river on the border between North Korea and China. Together with the Tumen River to its east, and a small portion of Paektu Mountain, the Yalu forms the border between North Korea and China and is notable as a site involved in military conflicts in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, World War II, and the Korean War.\n\nName\n\nThere are two versions regarding the origin of the river name. One version is that the name derived from \"Yalv ula\" in the Manchu language. The Manchu word \"Yalu\" means \"the boundary between two countries\". In Mandarin Chinese, \"Yalu\" phonetically approximates the original Manchu word \"Yalu\", but literally means \"Duck Green\", which was said to have been once the color of the river. The other version is that the river was named after the combination of its two upper branches, which was called \"Ya\" and \"Lu\" respectively.\n\nGeography\n\nFrom 2500\u00a0m above sea level on Paektu Mountain on the China\u2013North Korea border, the river flows south to Hyesan before sweeping 130\u00a0km northwest to Linjiang and then returning to a more southerly route for a further 300\u00a0km to empty into the Korea Bay between Dandong (China) and Sinuiju (North Korea). The bordering Chinese provinces are Jilin and Liaoning.\n\nThe river is 795\u00a0km (493\u00a0mi) long and receives the water from over 30,000\u00a0km\u00b2 of land. The Yalu's most significant tributaries are the Changjin (\uc7a5\uc9c4\uac15/), the Hochon (\ud5c8\ucc9c\uac15/), the Tokro (\ub3c5\ub85c\uac15/) and the Ai (\u7477\u6cb3) rivers. The river is not easily navigable for most of its length.  Most of the river freezes during winter and can be crossed on foot. \n\nThe depth of the Yalu River varies from some of the more shallow parts on the eastern side in Hyesan (1 metre) to the deeper parts of the river near the Yellow Sea (2.5 metres).  The estuary is the site of the Amrok River estuary Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International.\nChina has the longest combined land border in the world, measuring  22117 km from the mouth of the Yalu River to the Gulf of Tonkin. China borders 14 nations, more than any other country except Russia, which also borders 14.  China extends across much of East Asia, bordering Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar (Burma) in Southeast Asia; India, Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan, and Pakistan in South Asia;  Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia; and Russia, Mongolia, and North Korea in Inner Asia and Northeast Asia. Additionally, China shares maritime boundaries with South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines.\n\nLandscape and climate\n\nThe territory of China lies between latitudes 18\u00b0 and 54\u00b0 N, and longitudes 73\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 E. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast width. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. The world's highest point, Mount Everest (8,848m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.  The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake (\u2212154m) in the Turpan Depression.",

The show is hosted by Jimmy Carr and the current team captains are Sean Lock and Jon Richardson.\n\nThe show is based on statistics and opinion polls, and draws on polls produced by a variety of organisations and new polls commissioned for the programme, carried out by Harris Poll. The title is derived from a well-known advertising tagline for Whiskas cat food, which claimed that \"8 out of 10 cats prefer Whiskas\". \n\nOverview\n\nThe show is hosted by comedian Jimmy Carr and features two teams, consisting of a regular team captain and two celebrity guests each. Sean Lock has appeared as the first team captain since the show's inception; the opposing captain was originally Dave Spikey, who left after series 4 to pursue other projects and was replaced by Jason Manford.  Manford departed following series 10, and was replaced by Jon Richardson for series 11.[http://www.sroaudiences.com/shows.asp sro audiences]\n\nEvery week, the captains are joined by two celebrities from the likes of David Walliams and Alan Carr. Often, topical celebrities appear on the show, for example Ruth Badger following her appearance on The Apprentice.\n\nThe show is currently recorded at Pinewood Studios, previously at BBC Television Centre, typically the day before transmission. However, in the past few years, due to Jimmy Carr's stand-up schedule, certain episodes are pretaped and broadcast later as \"special\" episodes dealing with a particular subject.[http://www.sroaudiences.com/application.asp?show_id=407 sro audiences]\n\n2015 was the only year since the show began in 2005 in which a full series was not broadcast. Two Christmas Specials however were filmed for airing on 24 and 30 December 2015. 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown however aired for a total of 24 episodes throughout 2015.\n\nCurrent rounds\nDistraction is a game show that aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom from 31 October 2003 to 11 June 2004. Presented by comedian Jimmy Carr, the show involved contestants answering questions while being distracted in various bizarre, painful and humiliating ways.\n\nCarr was aided by \"distractors\", who as the name suggests, attempted to distract the contestants painfully or emotionally. Examples include losing contestants, nudists, creepy carny guys, tattoo/piercing experts, wrestlers, midgets, Roller Derby girls, professional athletes, paintball players, and a large bouncer-type male nicknamed \"Tiny\". Occasionally, a number of female assistants helped with some of the distractions; depending on the stunt being played, they could be referred to as \"Jimmy's interns\", \"farmer girls\", \"schoolgirls\" or \"ammo ladies.\"\n\nA quiz book, featuring most of the distractions seen on the show, was released by Carlton Books in late 2004.\n\nGameplay\n\nAt the start of the show, there are four contestants, usually two women and two men. Before the first round, they \"get to know each other\", finding out about each other's embarrassing moments, unique hobbies, strange talents, or previous unflattering occupations.\n\nThe first three rounds are usually quizzes involving rather easy questions. However, these rounds feature various distractions to cause pain and/or discomfort while contestants try to answer them. The distractions may be endured throughout the round, activated in order to answer questions, as punishment for incorrect answers, or as a result of getting a question right. On occasion, the contestants inflict an additional distraction on themselves (such as attaching clothespins to their own faces), with bonus points being awarded to the most successful of the four. At the end of each round, the player who has performed worst is eliminated and receives nothing.",

After a spell on remand in custody and a dramatic escape from the police and from members of the Firm who ambushed him on his way to court, viewers watched a mysterious gunman shoot at Den with a gun hidden in a bunch of daffodils, before hearing a splash. A shot depicting Den's death was cut from the final scene, in the hope that Grantham might one day be persuaded to return to the role. The following year, a body believed to be Den's was found in the canal.\n\nOther work\n\nFrom 1989 to 1990 he played Danny Kane in the crime television series The Paradise Club alongside Don Henderson. He went on to appear in many more television series such as Cluedo as Colonel Mustard, The Detectives (1993) and 99-1 (1994\u201395). In 1994 he narrated Volume One of Frank Harris's erotic classic My Life and Loves. \nIn 1997 he produced and starred in the sci-fi mini-series The Uninvited.\n\nHe then became best known as the co-host of the game show Fort Boyard alongside Melinda Messenger which he presented from 1998 to 2001. He also reunited with his EastEnders co-star Anita Dobson in a one-off television film entitled The Stretch which aired on ITV in 2000 and in a 2004 British gangster film titled Charlie.\n\nReturn to EastEnders\n\nOn 3 May 2003, it was confirmed that Grantham would be returning to EastEnders later that year to reprise his role as Dirty Den. On 29 September 2003, his return to EastEnders was aired. Den Watts, who had last appeared 14 years earlier, arrived at the nightclub now owned by his adopted daughter Sharon. The return of the character saw Grantham pick up the largest pay cheque in British soap with a reported \u00a3500,000-a-year contract.\nTelevision\n\nMessenger's TV career began in 1997 on Channel 4's Eurotrash. That same year she was given her own show on Channel 5 called Melinda's Big Night In.\n\nFrom 1998, Messenger became assistant in Fort Boyard on Five which ran for five series. She initially joined ex-Eastender Leslie Grantham and later Catweazle star Geoffrey Bayldon in the game show which tested contestants' physical agility and brainpower on the identically named sea fortress in France.\n\nIn 2002, she appeared on Celebrity Big Brother where she was described as a \"blonde Vulcan\" by fellow contestant Sue Perkins, who questioned her apparent lack of range of emotions. She has since presented many TV programmes, including Loose Lips (with Richard Arnold), Baby Baby, Can We Still Be Friends, Beat The Dealer and Beat The Crusher.\n\nIn 2004, she appeared on Age Swap episode of  Celebrity Swap as 83-year-old Margaret Doyle, supposedly Melinda\u2019s old ballet teacher, disguised with prosthetic make-up, a black lycra suit, a red-white wig and fake teeth. \n\nIn 2006, Messenger recorded a pilot for a gameshow called Messenger of Doom. It was essentially a remake of The Crystal Maze, with contestants completing a series of challenges in exchange for \"life candles.\" If a contestant failed to complete a challenge, a leather-clad Messenger appeared on screen with the words \"I send you to your doom, foolish traveller!\" The contestant then spent the next 20 minutes stripped to their underwear in an ice bath. The pilot was well received at test screenings, but the elaborate and expensive sets and costumes discouraged channels from commissioning a full series.\n\nIn 2008, Messenger has presented a host of programmes including for the BBC To Buy or Not to Buy, ITV's Bingo Night Live,  and A Garden For Eden for ITV Westcountry.",

    "question": "Who presented Family Fortunes in the two years between Bob Monkhouse and Les Dennis?",
    "answer": "Max Bygraves",
    "evidence": "Family Fortunes is a British television game show based on the American game show Family Feud. The programme ran on ITV from 6 January 1980 to 6 December 2002, before being revived by the same channel in 2006 under the title of All Star Family Fortunes. The game involves two families providing answers to 'everyday questions' that were surveyed by 100 members of the British public before the show (e.g. 'Name something usually done in the dark') to win cash prizes (and sometimes mystery prizes for giving a correct answer). The top answers to the surveys are displayed on a large electronic board, originally known as \"Mr. Babbage\", which famously sounds a wrong answer \"Eh-uhh\" sound effect and its accompanying X to signal the strike, as well as a \"ding\" for a right answer).\n\nHosts and presentation\n\nFamily Fortunes was first hosted by comedian Bob Monkhouse (1980\u201383) then by singer and entertainer Max Bygraves (1983\u201385). After being rested for the whole of 1986, the show returned on 27 June 1987 with Les Dennis as presenter, and had a consistently successful run for the next 15 years. It was then moved out of peak time and became a daily daytime show, hosted by Andy Collins, but it only had a short run in this format before being axed.\n\nIn 2006, the series was revived with Vernon Kay as host, and was renamed All Star Family Fortunes, as each team consisted of a celebrity and four family members. The show was also transmitted back to peak time. Prize money goes to a charity of the celebrity's choice, and contestants being either celebrity families, or a group of actors famous for playing a fictional family. Several Christmas specials of All Star Family Fortunes have aired as well.",

    "question": "Which planet has moons named after Shakespearean characters?",
    "answer": "Uranus",
    "evidence": "Some of them, such as Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris, were heralded in the popular press as the tenth planet, failing to receive widespread scientific recognition. The announcement of Eris in 2005, an object then thought of as 27% more massive than Pluto, created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet.\n\nAcknowledging the problem, the IAU set about creating the definition of planet, and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and a new class of dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris). \n\nExtrasolar planets \n\nThere is no official definition of extrasolar planets.  In 2003, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets issued a position statement, but this position statement was never proposed as an official IAU resolution and was never voted on by IAU members.  The positions statement incorporates the following guidelines, mostly focused upon the boundary between planets and brown dwarfs:\n# Objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 times the mass of Jupiter for objects with the same isotopic abundance as the Sun ) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are \"planets\" (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass and size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.\n# Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are \"brown dwarfs\", no matter how they formed or where they are located.\n# Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not \"planets\", but are \"sub-brown dwarfs\" (or whatever name is most appropriate).\nNatural satellites of the Solar System \n\nThe seven largest natural satellites in the Solar System (those bigger than 2,500\u00a0km across) are Jupiter's Galilean moons (Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa), Saturn's moon Titan, Earth's moon, and Neptune's captured natural satellite Triton. Triton, the smallest of these, has more mass than all smaller natural satellites together. Similarly in the next size group of nine natural satellites, between 1,000\u00a0km and 1,600\u00a0km across, Titania, Oberon, Rhea, Iapetus, Charon, Ariel, Umbriel, Dione, and Tethys, the smallest, Tethys, has more mass than all smaller natural satellites together. As well as the natural satellites of the various planets, there are also over 80 known natural satellites of the dwarf planets, minor planets and other small Solar System bodies. Some studies estimate that up to 15% of all trans-Neptunian objects could have satellites.\n\nThe following is a comparative table classifying the natural satellites in the Solar System by diameter. The column on the right includes some notable planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and trans-Neptunian objects for comparison. The natural satellites of the planets are named after mythological figures. These are predominantly Greek, except for the Uranian natural satellites, which are named after Shakespearean characters. The nineteen bodies massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium are in bold in the table below. Minor planets and satellites suspected but not proven to have achieved a hydrostatic equilibrium are italicized in the table below.\n\nTerminology\nUranus, the seventh planet of the Solar System, has 27 known moons, all of which are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Uranus's moons are divided into three groups: thirteen inner moons, five major moons, and nine irregular moons. The inner moons are small dark bodies that share common properties and origins with Uranus's rings. The five major moons are massive enough to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium, and four of them show signs of internally driven processes such as canyon formation and volcanism on their surfaces. The largest of these five, Titania, is 1,578\u00a0km in diameter and the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System, and about one-twentieth the mass of the Moon. The orbits of the regular moons are nearly coplanar with Uranus's equator, which is tilted 97.77\u00b0 to its orbit. Uranus's irregular moons have elliptical and strongly inclined (mostly retrograde) orbits at large distances from the planet.\n\nWilliam Herschel discovered the first two moons, Titania and Oberon, in 1787, and the other three ellipsoidal moons were discovered in 1851 by William Lassell (Ariel and Umbriel) and in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper (Miranda). These five have planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets if they were in direct orbit about the Sun. The remaining moons were discovered after 1985, either during the Voyager 2 flyby mission or with the aid of advanced Earth-based telescopes.\n\nDiscovery",

    "answer": "Robert Ludlum",
    "evidence": "'Bourne' is a series of three novels by Robert Ludlum based on the fictional spy Jason Bourne.  The series has since been further extended by Eric Van Lustbader after the death of Robert Ludlum.\n\nNovels\n\nThe original three Bourne novels by Ludlum are:\n*The Bourne Identity (1980)\n*The Bourne Supremacy (1986)\n*The Bourne Ultimatum (1990)\n\nThe continuation novels by Van Lustbader are:\n*The Bourne Legacy (2004)\n*The Bourne Betrayal (2007)\n*The Bourne Sanction (2008)\n*The Bourne Deception (2009)\n*The Bourne Objective (2010)\n*The Bourne Dominion (2011)\n*The Bourne Imperative (2012)\n*The Bourne Retribution (2013)\n*The Bourne Ascendancy (2014)\n*The Bourne Enigma (2016)\n\nFilms\n\nThe Bourne Identity has been adapted into live action twice. The first adaptation is a 1988 television film starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith. The second is a 2002 feature film series starring Matt Damon, which proved to be a strong critical and commercial success, launching the Bourne film series, which consists of five films, with the fifth featuring on the big screen in July 29, 2016  release.\nRobert Ludlum (May 25, 1927 \u2013 March 12, 2001) was an American author of 27 thriller novels, best known as the creator of Jason Bourne from the original The Bourne Trilogy series. The number of copies of his books in print is estimated between 290 million and 500 million.    They have been published in 33 languages and 40 countries. Ludlum also published books under the pseudonyms Jonathan Ryder and Michael Shepherd.\n\nLife and career\n\nEarly life and education\n\nLudlum was born in New York City, the son of Margaret (n\u00e9e Wadsworth) and George Hartford Ludlum.  His maternal grandparents were English.  He was educated at The Rectory School then Cheshire Academy and Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he earned a B.A. in Drama. While at Wesleyan, Ludlum joined the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. After becoming an author later in life, Ludlum would set his mystery novel Matlock Paper at the fictitious Carlyle University in Connecticut, a thinly disguised Wesleyan.  \n\nCareer\n\nPrior to becoming an author, he had been a United States Marine,  a theatrical actor and producer. In the 1950s, he produced shows at the Grant Lee theater in Fort Lee, NJ. From 1960 to 1970, he managed and produced shows at the Playhouse on the Mall in Paramus, New Jersey.  His theatrical experience may have contributed to his understanding of the energy, escapism and action that the public wanted in a novel. He once remarked: \"I equate suspense and good theater in a very similar way. I think it's all suspense and what-happens-next. From that point of view, yes, I guess, I am theatrical.\"",

    "answer": "Matthew",
    "evidence": "Other books\n\nBesides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are Daniel, Ezra\u2013Nehemiah and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics:\n* Their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e., the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion).\n* The Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them.\n* Two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in the Tanakh with significant portions in Aramaic.\n\nOrder of the books\n\nThe following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of Sifrei Emet and Hamesh Megillot.\n\nThe Three Poetic Books (Sifrei Emet)\n* Tehillim (Psalms) \u05ea\u05b0\u05d4\u05b4\u05dc\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd\n* Mishlei (Book of Proverbs) \u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9\n* Iyy\u00f4bh (Book of Job) \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\nThe Five Megillot (Hamesh Megillot)\n* Sh\u012br Hashsh\u012br\u012bm (Song of Songs) or (Song of Solomon) \u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05c1\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd (Passover)\n* R\u016bth (Book of Ruth) \u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea (Sh\u0101bh\u00fb\u2018\u00f4th)\n* Eikhah (Lamentations) \u05d0\u05d9\u05db\u05d4 (Ninth of Av) [Also called Kinnot in Hebrew.]\n* Q\u014dheleth (Ecclesiastes) \u05e7\u05d4\u05dc\u05ea (Sukk\u00f4th)\n* Est\u0113r (Book of Esther) \u05d0\u05b6\u05e1\u05b0\u05ea\u05b5\u05e8 (P\u00fbr\u00eem)\nOther books\n* D\u0101n\u00ee\u2019\u0113l (Book of Daniel) \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05b5\u05bc\u05d0\u05dc\n* \u2018Ezr\u0101 (Book of Ezra-Book of Nehemiah) \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d0\n* Divrei ha-Yamim (Chronicles) \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd\n\nThe Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in Ketuvim. The Babylonian Talmud (Bava Batra 14b-15a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles. \n\nIn Tiberian Masoretic codices, including the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex, and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Esther, Daniel, Ezra. \n\nCanonization\nQueen Helen\u2026 began to think greatly of the bodies of these three kings, and she arrayed herself, and accompanied by many attendants, went into the Land of Ind\u2026 after she had found the bodies of Melchior, Balthazar, and Gaspar, Queen Helen put them into one chest and ornamented it with great riches, and she brought them into Constantinople... and laid them in a church that is called Saint Sophia.\n\nReligious significance\n\nThe visit of the Magi is commemorated in most Western Christian churches by the observance of Epiphany, 6 January, which also serves as the feast of the three as saints.  The Eastern Orthodox celebrate the visit of the Magi on 25 December.\n\nThe identification of the Magi as kings is linked to Old Testament prophesies that have the Messiah being worshipped by kings in Isaiah 60:3, Psalm 72:10, and Psalm 68:29. Early readers reinterpreted Matthew in light of these prophecies and elevated the Magi to kings. By AD 500 all commentators adopted the prevalent tradition that the three were kings, and this continued until the Protestant Reformation. \n\nThough the Qur'an omits Matthew's episode of the Magi, it was well known in Arabia. The Muslim encyclopaedist al-Tabari, writing in the 9th century, gives the familiar symbolism of the gifts of the Magi. Al-Tabari gave his source for the information to be the later 7th century writer Wahb ibn Munabbih. \n\nTraditions\n\nHolidays celebrating the arrival of the Magi traditionally recognise a distinction between the date of their arrival and the date of Jesus' birth. The account given in the Gospel of Matthew does not state that they were present on the night of the birth; in the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary remain in Bethlehem until it is time for Jesus' dedication, in Jerusalem, and then return to their home in Nazareth.\n\nSpanish customs\nIn Matthew, Joseph is troubled because Mary, his betrothed, is pregnant (Matthew 1:19\u201320), but in the first of Joseph's three dreams an angel assures him not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife, because her child was conceived by the Holy Spirit.\nIn Matthew 2:1\u201312, wise men or Magi from the East bring gifts to the young Jesus as the King of the Jews. Herod hears of Jesus' birth and, wanting him killed, orders the murders of male infants in Bethlehem. But an angel warns Joseph in his second dream, and the family flees to Egypt\u2014later to return and settle in Nazareth. \n\nIn Luke 1:31\u201338 Mary learns from the angel Gabriel that she will conceive and bear a child called Jesus through the action of the Holy Spirit. When Mary is due to give birth, she and Joseph travel from Nazareth to Joseph's ancestral home in Bethlehem to register in the census ordered by Caesar Augustus. While there Mary gives birth to Jesus, and as they have found no room in the inn, she places the newborn in a manger (Luke 2:1\u20137). An angel announces the birth to some shepherds, who go to Bethlehem to see Jesus, and subsequently spread the news abroad (Luke 2:8\u201320). After the presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Joseph, Mary and Jesus return to Nazareth.\n\nEarly life, family, and profession \n\nJesus' childhood home is identified in the gospels of Luke and Matthew as the town of Nazareth in Galilee where he lived with his family. Although Joseph appears in descriptions of Jesus' childhood, no mention is made of him thereafter.  His other family members\u2014his mother, Mary, his brothers James, Joses (or Joseph), Judas and Simon and his unnamed sisters\u2014are mentioned in the gospels and other sources.",

    "evidence": "Athos, Count de la F\u00e8re, is a fictional character in the novels The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte de Bragelonne by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re.  He is a highly fictionalised version of the historical musketeer Armand de Sill\u00e8gue d'Athos d'Autevielle (1615\u20131644).\n\nIn the novels\n\nIn The Three Musketeers, he and the other two musketeers, Porthos and Aramis, are friends of the novel's protagonist, d'Artagnan. He has a mysterious past connecting him with the villain of the novel, Milady de Winter. In one part of the book, he drunkenly implicates himself as the murderer of a sixteen-year-old girl, which disturbs d'Artagnan.\n\nThe oldest by some years, Athos is described as noble and handsome but also very secretive, drowning his secret sorrows in drink. He is very protective of d'Artagnan, the youngest, whom he treats as a son.\n\nBy the end of the novel, it is revealed that he is the Count de la F\u00e8re, who was Milady's husband before she married the Baron de Winter.\n\nIn the latter two novels, he is openly known as the Count de la F\u00e8re and is the adopted father of the young hero, Raoul, vicomte de Bragelonne (and it is ultimately revealed that he is his biological father as well). In Twenty Years After, it is left uncertain whether Athos is the father of Mordaunt (John Francis de Winter, son of Milady). Mordaunt attempts to avenge the death of his mother by killing those responsible. However, he himself dies while he and Athos struggle in the middle of the English Channel. Athos himself almost drowns in this struggle as well causing Aramis, Porthos, and d'Artagnan to lament his death for a few moments before he resurfaces.\n\nAthos' first name is never told in the novels. However, in Dumas' play \"The Youth of the Musketeers,\" the young Milady, then named Charlotte, calls the then Vicomte de la F\u00e8re, Olivier.\n\nSources\nPorthos, Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds is a fictional character in the novels The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After and The Vicomte de Bragelonne by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re.  He and the other two musketeers, Athos and Aramis, are friends of the novel's protagonist, d'Artagnan.\n\nIn The Three Musketeers his family name is du Vallon. In Twenty Years After, having made a financially advantageous marriage, he is first known as du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,  before he earns the title of Baron.\n\nPorthos, honest and slightly gullible, is the extrovert of the group, enjoying wine, women and song. Though he is often seen as the comic relief, he is also extremely dedicated and loyal toward his friends and fellow Musketeers. His eating abilities even impress King Louis XIV during a banquet at Versailles. As the story advances, he looks more and more of a giant, and his death is that of a titan. \n\nAt the time of The Three Musketeers (ca. 1627) he apparently has few lands or other resources to draw from. He was finally able to extract sufficient funds from an elderly lawyer's somewhat younger wife (whom he was romancing and later married) to equip himself for the Siege of La Rochelle.\n\nThe fictional Porthos is very loosely based on the historical musketeer Isaac de Porthau.\n\nFilm and television\n3 Musketeers is a direct-to-video action film by The Asylum loosely based on The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. The film is directed by Cole McKay and is a mockbuster that was released shortly after the Paul W. S. Anderson film The Three Musketeers. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray disc on October 25, 2011. \n\nUnlike other adaptations of The Three Musketeers, this film is a modern take on the original story.\n\nPlot \n\nSet in the near-future USA, when junior NSA officer Alexandra D'Artagnan uncovers a plot by a corrupt general to assassinate the President of the United States to instigate a coup to take over the government in order to install a militarist regime, she enlists the help of three infamous international spies to stop the threat.\n\nCast\n\n*Heather Hemmens as Alexandra D'Artagnan\n*XIN as Athos\n*Keith Allan as Porthos\n*Michele Boyd as Aramis\n*David Chokachi as Lewis\n*Darren Thomas as Rockford\n*Alan Rachins as Treville\n*Simon Rhee as a Commander\n*Andy Clemence as President King\n*Edward DeRuiter as Jenkins",

    "question": "What is the name of the plastic bit on the end of shoelaces?",
    "answer": "An aglet",
    "evidence": "History \n\nIt is as difficult to determine the exact history of shoelaces as it is for shoes. Archaeological records of footwear are rare because shoes were generally made of materials that deteriorated readily. The Areni-1 shoe, which has been dated to around 3500 BC, is a simple leather \"shoe\" with leather \"shoelaces\" passing through slotted \"eyelets\" cut into the hide. The more complex shoes worn by \u00d6tzi the Iceman, who lived around 3300 BC, were bound with \"shoelaces\" made of lime bark string.\n\nAs for shoelaces in the sense that we know them in modern times, the Museum of London has documented examples of medieval footwear dating from as far back as the 12th century, which clearly show the lacing passing through a series of hooks or eyelets down the front or side of the shoe. \n\nMyths\n\nA popular myth states that Gurkha soldiers, fighting for Britain, crawled along the ground, feeling the laces of the soldiers they encountered. British soldiers employed straight- or bar-lacing, while Japanese troops employed a criss-cross pattern. Criss-cross laces could therefore mean the difference between life and death. The importance of correct lacing was thus emphasized to British troops.  Whether true or not, there is an account of Gurkha soldiers checking the boots and laces of soldiers they encounter in the dark to find if they are friend or foe. \n\nShoelace accessories\nAn aglet (or aiglet) is a small sheath, often made of plastic or metal, used on each end of a shoelace, cord, or drawstring. An aglet keeps the fibers of the lace or cord from unraveling; its firmness and narrow profile make it easier to hold and easier to feed through the eyelets, lugs, or other lacing guides.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word aglet (or aiglet) comes from Old French; aguillette, which is the diminutive of aguille (or aiguille), meaning needle. The original word for needle in Latin is \"acus\" which is where the word aglet comes from.  \n\nVariety\n\nThere is a subtle distinction between aglets, which are generally functional, and aiguillettes, which are generally decorative. The latter usually appear at the end of decorative cords, such as bolo ties, and the identically named aiguillettes of military dress uniforms.\n\nAglets today are most often made of plastic; they also have been made of metal, glass, and stone. Many were highly ornamental and made of precious metals such as silver. Before the invention of buttons, they were used on the ends of ribbons to fasten clothing together. Sometimes they were formed into small figures. Shakespeare calls this type of figure an \"aglet baby\" in The Taming of the Shrew.\n\nHomemade aglets can be fashioned out of adhesive tape, wax, resin, glue, thread, heat shrink or metal tubing, and by simply knotting or melting the end of a lace or cord.",

By 2015, the city council area had an estimated population of 478,580  whilst the Liverpool/Birkenhead metropolitan area had a population over 2.2 million.  Liverpool is the principal city within the Liverpool City Region.\n\nLiverpool sits on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary and historically lay within the ancient hundred of West Derby in the south west of the county of Lancashire. It became a borough from 1207 and a city from 1880. The expansion of the city in the Industrial Revolution paralleled its growth as a major port, and participation in the Atlantic slave trade. Liverpool was the port of registry of the ocean liner RMS Titanic, and many other Cunard and White Star ocean liners such as the RMS Lusitania, Queen Mary, and Olympic.\n\nThe city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007, and it held the European Capital of Culture title together with Stavanger, Norway, in 2008.  Several areas of Liverpool city centre were granted World Heritage Site status by UNESCO in 2004. The Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City includes the Pier Head, Albert Dock, and William Brown Street.  Tourism forms a significant part of the city's economy.   Labelled the \"World Capital City of Pop\" by Guinness World Records, the popularity of The Beatles and other groups from the Merseybeat era and later contributes to Liverpool's status as a tourist destination.   Liverpool is also the home of two Premier League football clubs, Liverpool and Everton, matches between the two being known as the Merseyside derby. The world-famous Grand National horse race takes place annually at Aintree Racecourse on the outskirts of the city.\nLiverpool Football Club, an English professional association football club, is Britain's most successful team in Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions. Since 1964, they have won eleven European trophies: the UEFA Champions League (formerly known as the European Cup) five times, the UEFA Europa League (formerly known as the UEFA Cup) three times, and the UEFA Super Cup three times.\n\nQualification for European competitions is determined by a team's success in its domestic league and cup competitions from the previous season. Liverpool competed in European competitions for 21 consecutive seasons until the 1985 European Cup Final, the occasion of the Heysel Stadium disaster, following which the club was banned from European competitions for six seasons. Since being readmitted in 1991, they have qualified for the Champions League (the successor to the European Cup) eight times and the UEFA Cup (the predecessor to the Europa League) seven times.\n\nAs a result of their victory in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, Liverpool won the European Champion Clubs' Cup trophy outright, and were awarded a multiple winner badge. Only Real Madrid (ten) and Milan (seven) have won the competition on more occasions. Liverpool's total of three UEFA Cup wins has been bettered only by Sevilla, who have won the competition five times. They have also won the UEFA Super Cup on three occasions, a total only Milan and Barcelona (five titles each)  have bettered.\n\nBob Paisley is the club's most successful manager in Europe, with five trophies. Liverpool's biggest-margin win in Europe is an 11\u20130 victory over Str\u00f8msgodset in the 1974\u201375 European Cup Winners' Cup.

    "question": "The Sign Of Four was a detective story written by which author?",
    "answer": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle",
    "evidence": "Plot\n\nThe Sign of the Four (1890), also called The Sign of Four, is the second novel featuring Sherlock Holmes written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Doyle wrote four novels and 56 stories starring the fictional detective.\n\nThe story is set in 1888.  The Sign of the Four has a complex plot involving service in East India Company, India, the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a stolen treasure, and a secret pact among four convicts (\"the Four\" of the title) and two corrupt prison guards. It presents the detective's drug habit and humanizes him in a way that had not been done in the preceding novel, A Study in Scarlet (1887). It also introduces Doctor Watson's future wife, Mary Morstan.\n\nAccording to Mary, in December 1878, her father had telegraphed her upon his safe return from India and requested her to meet him at the Langham Hotel in London. When Mary arrived at the hotel, she was told her father had gone out the previous night and not returned. Despite all efforts, no trace has ever been found of him. Mary contacted her father's only friend who was in the same regiment and had since retired to England, one Major John Sholto, but he denied knowing her father had returned. The second puzzle is that she has received six pearls in the mail from an anonymous benefactor, one per year since 1882 after answering an anonymous newspaper query inquiring for her. With the last pearl she received a letter remarking that she has been a wronged woman and asking for a meeting. Holmes takes the case and soon discovers that Major Sholto had died in 1882 and that within a short span of time Mary began to receive the pearls, implying a connection. The only clue Mary can give Holmes is a map of a fortress found in her father's desk with the names of Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan and Dost Akbar.\nIn 1887, Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes, arguably the most famous of all fictional detectives. Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original fiction detective (he was influenced by Poe's Dupin and Gaboriau's Lecoq), his name has become a byword for the part. Conan Doyle stated that the character of Holmes was inspired by Dr. Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle had worked as a clerk at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions from the smallest observations.  A brilliant London-based \"consulting detective\" residing at 221B Baker Street, Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and is renowned for his skillful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning, and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, and all but four stories are narrated by Holmes's friend, assistant, and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson.\n\nGolden Age detective novels\n\nThe period of the 1920s and 1930s is generally referred to as the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. During this period, a number of very popular writers emerged, mostly British but with a notable subset of American and New Zealand writers. Female writers constituted a major portion of notable Golden Age writers, including Agatha Christie, the most famous of the Golden Age writers, and among the most famous authors of any genre, of all time. Four female writers of the Golden Age are considered the four original \"Queens of Crime\": Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh and Margery Allingham. Apart from Ngaio Marsh (a New Zealander) they were British.",

The Old Curiosity Shop was printed in book form in 1841.\n\nQueen Victoria read the novel in 1841, finding it \"very interesting and cleverly written.\" \n\nPlot summary\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop tells the story of Nell Trent, a beautiful and virtuous young girl of \"not quite fourteen\". An orphan, she lives with her maternal grandfather (whose name is never revealed) in his shop of odds and ends.

    "question": "What are the shape-shifting foxes of the Japanese folklore?",
    "answer": "Kitsune",
    "evidence": "Servants of Inari\n\nKitsune are associated with Inari, the Shinto deity of rice.  This association has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance.  Originally, kitsune were Inari's messengers, but the line between the two is now blurred so that Inari \u014ckami may be depicted as a fox. Likewise, entire shrines are dedicated to kitsune, where devotees can leave offerings. Fox spirits are said to be particularly fond of a fried sliced tofu called aburage, which is accordingly found in the noodle-based dishes kitsune udon and kitsune soba. Similarly, Inari-zushi is a type of sushi named for Inari \u014ckami that consists of rice-filled pouches of fried tofu.  There is speculation among folklorists as to whether another Shinto fox deity existed in the past. Foxes have long been worshipped as kami. \n\nInari's kitsune are white, a color of good omen. They possess the power to ward off evil, and they sometimes serve as guardian spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene on behalf of the locals and particularly to aid against troublesome nogitsune, those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.\n\nAccording to beliefs derived from fusui (feng shui), the fox's power over evil is such that a mere statue of a fox can dispel the evil kimon, or energy, that flows from the northeast. Many Inari shrines, such as the famous Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto, feature such statues, sometimes large numbers of them.\n\nKitsune are connected to the Buddhist religion through the Dakiniten, goddesses conflated with Inari's female aspect. Dakiniten is depicted as a female boddhisattva wielding a sword and riding a flying white fox. \n\nTricksters\nClassic folktales\n\nClassic folktales such as Momotar\u014d, which most Japanese today are familiarized through pictured children's storybooks, manga, or other popularizations, can be traced to picture-books printed in the Edo Period, though their prototypical stories may go back much further. The versions retold by children's story author ' (1870\u20131933)   had a strong hand in establishing the forms usually known today.\n\nAnimals in folktales\n\nTwo creatures are particularly known for their abilities to transform into humans or other beings and objects, the kitsune (fox) and tanuki (the raccoon dog; pictured). They occur frequently in folktales of humorous nature.\n\nMarriages between humans and non-humans () comprise a major category or motif in Japanese folklore. Japanese heterotype examples such as the crane story describes a sustained period of married life between the interspecies couple, in contrast to Western examples like Frog Prince or the Leda myth where the supernatural encounter is brief. An unusual pairing occurs in the story of the , which exist in both a politer written version (Otogiz\u014dshi) and in a more rustic and vulgar oral tale. The gender is reversed in the tale of ' where a bride is wedded to a tiny tanishi (river snail).\n\nModern renditions\n\nA number of folktales were adapted for stage performance by playwright Junji Kinoshita, notably Y\u016bzuru (Twilight Crane, 1949),  based on the folktale Tsuru no Ongaeshi or \"a crane who repaid its gratitude\".\n\nIn the American television series called The Yokai King, starring by Shin Koyamada, the characters are based on the Japanese folklore creatures.\n\nFantastic creatures",

    "evidence": "In Greek and Roman mythology, Castor  and Pollux  or Polydeuces;  Poludeuk\u0113s \"much sweet wine\" were twin brothers, together known as the Dioskouri.  Their mother was Leda, but Castor was the mortal son of Tyndareus, the king of Sparta, and Pollux the divine son of Zeus, who seduced Leda in the guise of a swan. Though accounts of their birth are varied, they are sometimes said to have been born from an egg, along with their twin sisters and half-sisters Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra.\n\nIn Latin the twins are also known as the Gemini  or Castores.  When Castor was killed, Pollux asked Zeus to let him share his own immortality with his twin to keep them together, and they were transformed into the constellation Gemini. The pair were regarded as the patrons of sailors, to whom they appeared as St. Elmo's fire, and were also associated with horsemanship.\n\nThey are sometimes called the Tyndaridae or Tyndarids,  later seen as a reference to their father and stepfather Tyndareus.\n\nBirth and functions\n\nThe best-known story of the twins' birth is that Zeus disguised himself as a swan and seduced Leda. Thus Leda's children are frequently said to have hatched from two eggs that she then produced. The Dioscuri can be recognized in vase-paintings by the skull-cap they wear, the pilos, which was explained in antiquity as the remnants of the egg.  Whether the children are thus mortal or half-immortal is not consistent among accounts, nor is whether the twins hatched together from one egg. In some accounts, only Pollux was fathered by Zeus, while Leda and her husband Tyndareus conceived Castor. This explains why they were granted an alternate immortality. It is a common belief that one would live among the gods, while the other was among the dead. The figure of Tyndareus may have entered their tradition to explain their archaic name Tindaridai in Spartan inscriptions or in literature Tyndaridai, in turn occasioning incompatible accounts of their parentage.",

    "question": "Marilyn Monroe starred in the Seven Year Itch. Who directed it?",
    "answer": "Billy Wilder",
    "evidence": "In September 1954, Monroe began filming Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch, in which she starred opposite Tom Ewell as a woman who becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of one scene on Lexington Avenue in New York. In it, Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress, which became one of the most famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.\n\nWhile the publicity stunt placed Monroe on front pages all over the world, it also marked the end of her marriage to DiMaggio, who was furious about it. The union had been troubled from the start by his jealousy and controlling attitude; Spoto and Banner have also asserted that he was physically abusive. After returning to Hollywood, Monroe hired famous attorney Jerry Giesler and announced that she was filing for divorce in October 1954. The Seven Year Itch was released the following June, and grossed over $4.5 million at the box office, making it one of the biggest commercial successes that year.\nThe Seven Year Itch is a 1955 American romantic comedy film based on a three-act play with the same name by George Axelrod. The film was co-written and directed by Billy Wilder, and stars Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell, reprising his Broadway role from the play. It contains one of the most iconic images of the 20th century\u00a0\u2013 Monroe standing on a subway grate as her white dress  is blown upwards by a passing train. The titular phrase, which refers to declining interest in a monogamous relationship after seven years of marriage, has been used by psychologists. \n\nPlot\n\nRichard Sherman (Tom Ewell) is a nerdy, faithful, middle-aged publishing executive with an overactive imagination and a mid-life crisis, whose wife, Helen (Evelyn Keyes), and son, Ricky (Butch Bernard), are spending the summer in Maine. When he returns home with the kayak paddle Ricky accidentally left behind, he meets a woman (Marilyn Monroe), who is a commercial actress and former model who rents the apartment upstairs while in town to make television spots for a brand of toothpaste. That evening, he works on reading the manuscript of a book in which psychiatrist Dr. Brubaker (Oskar Homolka) claims that almost all men are driven to have extra-marital affairs in the seventh year of marriage. Sherman has an imaginary conversation with Helen, trying to convince her, in three fantasy sequences, that he is irresistible to women, including his secretary, a nurse, and Helen's bridesmaid, but she laughs it off. A tomato plant then crashes into his lounge chair; the woman upstairs apologizes for accidentally knocking it off the balcony, and Richard invites her down for a drink.",

Celebrity Big Brother aired in March 2001 as a one-time special on Channel 4 in association with the BBC's Comic Relief charity telethon.  It lasted for eight days, and was ultimately won by comedian Jack Dee.  With the first series proving to be a success, a second series was later confirmed.  Celebrity Big Brother 2 premiered on 20 November 2002, and concluded when Mark Owen was crowned the winner after 10 days in the house.   Celebrity Big Brother did not air for the next two years, with Channel 4 choosing to air the spin-off series Teen Big Brother: The Experiment in 2003 and Big Brother Panto in 2004.    In 2005, the show officially returned with its third series, which launched on 6 January.  Lasting for a total of eighteen days, the series was won by Mark \"Bez\" Berry.   The fourth edition of the show premiered on 5 January 2006 and was won by Chantelle Houghton, who ironically enough was the only housemate to not be a celebrity.   The fifth series launched on 3 January 2007.  This series saw Jade Goody, who had rose to fame after appearing on Big Brother 3, enter the house as a housemate.  The fifth series became the most controversial series to date, when accusations of racism towards housemate Shilpa Shetty arose against Goody and other housemates.    Shetty ultimately went on to win the series, while Goody was evicted after spending two weeks in the house.

    "evidence": "Three riders have won 8 stages in a single year: Charles P\u00e9lissier (1930 ), Eddy Merckx (1970, 1974 ), Freddy Maertens (1976 ). Mark Cavendish has the most mass finish stage wins with 30 as of stage 14 in 2016, ahead of Andr\u00e9 Darrigade and Andr\u00e9 Leducq with 22, Fran\u00e7ois Faber with 19 and Eddy Merckx with 18.  The youngest Tour de France stage winner is Fabio Battesini, who was 19 when he won one stage in the 1931 Tour de France. \n\nThe fastest massed-start stage was in 1999 from Laval to Blois (194.5\u00a0km), won by Mario Cipollini at 50.4\u00a0km/h.  The fastest time-trial is Rohan Dennis' stage 1 of the 2015 Tour de France in Utrecht, won at an average of .   The fastest stage win was by the 2013 Orica GreenEDGE team in a team time-trial. It completed the 25\u00a0km in Nice (stage 5) at 57.8\u00a0km/h.  \n\nThe longest successful post-war breakaway by a single rider was by Albert Bourlon in the 1947 Tour de France.

That record belongs to Jos\u00e9-Luis Viejo, who beat the peloton by 22\u00a0m 50s in the 1976 stage Montgen\u00e8vre-Manosque. He was the fourth and most recent rider to win a stage by more than 20 minutes.\n\nThe only rider to win the Tour de France and an Olympic gold medal in the same year was Bradley Wiggins in 2012. Wiggins also has the record of being the only Tour de France champion to win an Olympic gold medal in the velodrome.\n\nRecord winners\n\nFour riders have won five times: Jacques Anquetil (FRA), Eddy Merckx (BEL), Bernard Hinault (FRA) and Miguel Indurain (ESP). Indurain achieved the mark with a record five consecutive wins.\n\nNotes\nHe acquired the nickname \"The Cannibal\" after a teammate told his daughter of how Merckx would not let anyone else win, and the daughter referred to him as a cannibal. Merckx achieved 525 victories over his eighteen-year career.

Merckx was successful on the road and also on the track, as well as in the large stage races and one-day races. He is widely thought to be the greatest and most successful rider in the history of cycling. However, Merckx was caught in three separate doping incidents during his career.\n\nSince Merckx's retirement from the sport on 18 May 1978, he has remained active in the cycling world. He began his own bicycle chain, Eddy Merckx Cycles, in 1980 and its bicycles were used by several professional teams in the 1980s and 1990s.

Artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger introduced the character in Detective Comics #58 (December 1941). The Penguin is one of Batman's most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's rogues gallery.\n\nThe Penguin is depicted as being a short, portly man who uses specialized, high-tech umbrellas as weapons. A mobster and thief, he fancies himself as being a \"gentleman of crime\". The Penguin runs a nightclub called Iceberg Lounge, which provides a cover for criminal activity, and Batman sometimes uses the nightclub as a source of criminal underworld information. According to Kane, the character was inspired from the then advertising mascot of Kool cigarettes\u00a0\u2013 a penguin with a top hat and cane. Finger thought the image of high-society gentlemen in tuxedos was reminiscent of emperor penguins. \n\nBurgess Meredith portrayed the Penguin in the 1960s Batman television series and its movie. Danny DeVito played a darker, more grotesque version in the 1992 film Batman Returns. Subsequent Batman animated series featured him in depictions that alternated between deformed outcast and high-profile aristocrat, or a blend of the two. Robin Lord Taylor currently portrays a young Penguin in the television series Gotham. The Penguin has repeatedly been named one of the best Batman villains, and one of the greatest villains in comics      and, paradoxically, has also been described by others as among the least convincing.

The Earps rented a cabin from Rex Beach for $100 a month and spent the winter of 1898\u20131899 there. He managed a small store during the spring of 1899 in St. Michael on the Norton Sound, a major gateway to the Alaskan interior via the Yukon River.   By this time he decided the rush to stake a claim in the Klondike was over. Earp headed for Nome, Alaska, instead. In September, Earp and partner Charles E. Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon in Nome, the city's first two story wooden building and its largest and most luxurious saloon. The second floor had twelve \"clubrooms\" upstairs decorated with fine mirrors, thick carpets, draperies, and sideboards. The building was used for a variety of purposes because it was so large: 70 x with 12 ft ceilings. Earp used the club rooms upstairs as a brothel, another fact that Josephine worked hard to see was omitted from stories about him.\n\nOn July 6, 1900,  Wyatt's brother Warren was shot and killed in a saloon in Willcox, Arizona. Wyatt learned about his death soon after, and although there are some modern rumors that he went to Arizona to avenge his brother's death, no evidence has been found to support that theory.\n\nWhile in Alaska, Wyatt rubbed elbows with future novelist Rex Beach, writer Jack London, playwright Wilson Mizner, and boxing promoter Tex Rickard, with whom Earp developed a long-lasting relationship. Rickard was a partner in the Northern Saloon and gambling house in Nome. Both the Dexter and the Northern Saloon competed for business with more than 60 other saloons in town serving an estimated 20,000 residents.

    "question": "Which famous cowboy was created by George W. Trendle?",
    "answer": "The Lone Ranger",
    "evidence": "Another Trendle-Campbell radio station (WPON) went on the air in December 1954. The station was located in Pontiac, Michigan, with studios in the Waldron Hotel in downtown Pontiac. Trendle and Campbell were reportedly still in charge of station operations in the late 1960s. In 1987, WPON's transmitter was moved from Pontiac to Walled Lake. The station is currently owned by Southfield-based Birach Broadcasting and has a talk-and-oldies format.\n\nPenny pinching\n\nThe Kunsky-Trendle business venture began at the start of the Great Depression, and Trendle took many cost-cutting moves that earned him a reputation as a penny-pincher. According to Dick Osgood in his book Wyxie Wonderland: An Unauthorized 50-Year Diary of WXYZ Detroit, he was assisted in this by H. Allen Campbell.\n\nCampbell was an advertising salesman for the Hearst organization whom Trendle hired to find sponsors for his radio programs. Campbell is credited with signing Silvercup Bread (of the Gordon Baking Company) as the first sponsor for the Lone Ranger series. This was a big account and helped to bring the show to nationwide syndication. Apparently, Campbell's contributions to the business were significant. He continued working for Trendle for the next twenty years and eventually became one of Trendle's business partners.\n\nCampbell reportedly kept a set of books to show employees that the company was losing money and could not afford to pay higher salaries. Trendle and Campbell often responded to employee requests for salary increases by downplaying their value to the company and threatening to fire them. This threat was particularly effective during the Depression.\n\nTrendle specified the music on WXYZ shows should be non-copyrighted classical so that the music was royalty-free.

    "question": "Which economist wrote The Wealth Of Nations?",
    "answer": "Adam Smith",
    "evidence": "The Economist is an English-language weekly newspaper owned by the Economist Group and edited in offices based in London.    Continuous publication began under founder James Wilson in September 1843. For historical reasons, The Economist refers to itself as a newspaper, but each print edition appears on small glossy paper like a news magazine. In 2006, its average weekly circulation was reported to be 1.5 million, about half of which were sold in the United States.\n\nThe publication belongs to the Economist Group. It is 50% owned by the English branch of the Rothschild family and by the Agnelli family through its holding company Exor. The remaining 50% is held by private investors including the editors and staff.   The Rothschilds and the Agnellis are represented on the board of directors.  A board of trustees formally appoints the editor, who cannot be removed without its permission. Although The Economist has a global emphasis and scope, about two-thirds of the 75 staff journalists are based in the City of Westminster, London.  As of March 2014, the Economist Group declared operating profit of \u00a359m.  Previous major shareholders include Pearson PLC. \n\nThe Economist claims that it \"is not a chronicle of economics.\"  It takes an editorial stance of classical and economic liberalism which is supportive of free trade, globalisation, free immigration and cultural liberalism (such as supporting legal recognition for same-sex marriage or drug liberalization). The publication has described itself as \"a product of the Caledonian liberalism of Adam Smith and David Hume.\" \nIt targets highly educated readers and claims an audience containing many influential executives and policy-makers.  The newspaper's CEO described this recent global change, which was first noticed in the 1990s and accelerated in the beginning of the 21st century, as a \"new age of Mass Intelligence.\"  \n\nMission statement\nAn Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, generally referred to by its shortened title The Wealth of Nations, is the magnum opus of the Scottish economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith.  First published in 1776, the book offers one of the world's first collected descriptions of what builds nations' wealth, and is today a fundamental work in classical economics.  By reflecting upon the economics at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the book touches upon such broad topics as the division of labour, productivity, and free markets.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Wealth of Nations was published 9 March 1776, during the Scottish Enlightenment and the Scottish Agricultural Revolution.  It influenced a number of authors and economists, as well as governments and organizations. For example, Alexander Hamilton was influenced in part by The Wealth of Nations to write his Report on Manufactures, in which he argued against many of Smith's policies. Interestingly, Hamilton based much of this report on the ideas of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, and it was, in part, Colbert's ideas that Smith responded to with The Wealth of Nations.\n\nMany other authors were influenced by the book and used it as a starting point in their own work, including Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus and, later, Ludwig von Mises. The Russian national poet Aleksandr Pushkin refers to The Wealth of Nations in his 1833 verse-novel Eugene Onegin.\nA large-scale memorial of Smith by Alexander Stoddart was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. It is a 10 ft-tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the Royal Mile outside St\u00a0Giles' Cathedral in Parliament Square, near the Mercat cross.  20th-century sculptor Jim Sanborn (best known for the Kryptos sculpture at the United States Central Intelligence Agency) has created multiple pieces which feature Smith's work. At Central Connecticut State University is Circulating Capital, a tall cylinder which features an extract from The Wealth of Nations on the lower half, and on the upper half, some of the same text but represented in binary code.  At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, outside the Belk College of Business Administration, is Adam Smith's Spinning Top.   Another Smith sculpture is at Cleveland State University.  He also appears as the narrator in the 2013 play The Low Road, centred on a proponent on laissez-faire economics in the late eighteenth century but dealing obliquely with the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 and the recession which followed \u2013 in the premiere production, he was portrayed by Bill Paterson.\n\nResidence\n\nAdam Smith resided at Panmure house from 1778\u201390. This residence has now been purchased by the Edinburgh Business School at Heriot Watt University and fundraising has begun to restore it.   Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry.\n\nAs a symbol of free market economics\n\nSmith has been celebrated by advocates of free market policies as the founder of free market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the Adam Smith Institute in London, the Adam Smith Society  and the Australian Adam Smith Club,  and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.",

    "question": "Macbeth belonged to which royal house or dynasty?",
    "answer": "House of Dunkeld",
    "evidence": "These French and Roman Catholic connections proved unpopular and resulted in the downfall of the Stuarts, whose mutual enemies identified with Protestantism and because James VII and II offended the Anglican establishment by proposing tolerance not only for Catholics but for Protestant Dissenters. The Glorious Revolution caused the overthrow of King James in favour of his son-in-law and his daughter, William and Mary. James continued to claim the thrones of England and Scotland to which he had been crowned, and encouraged revolts in his name, and his grandson Charles (also known as Bonnie Prince Charlie) led an ultimately unsuccessful rising in 1745, ironically becoming symbols of conservative rebellion and Romanticism. Some blame the identification of the Roman Catholic Church with the Stuarts for the extremely lengthy delay in the passage of Catholic Emancipation until Jacobitism (as represented by direct Stuart heirs) was extinguished; however it was as likely to be caused by entrenched anti-Catholic prejudice among the Anglican establishment of England. Despite the Whig intentions of tolerance to be extended to Irish subjects, this was not the preference of Georgian Tories and their failure at compromise played a subsequent role in the present division of Ireland. \n\nPresent-day",

    "question": "What is the full name of the train robber played by Phil Collins in a 1988 movie?",
    "answer": "Buster Edwards",
    "evidence": "Collins's first film role since embarking on his career as a musician came in 1988 with the romantic comedy-drama Buster. He starred as Buster Edwards, a criminal convicted for his role in the Great Train Robbery, which took place in England in August 1963. Reviews for the film were mixed and controversy ensued over its subject matter, with Prince Charles and Princess Diana deciding to withdraw from attending the film's premi\u00e8re after it was accused of glorifying crime.  However, Collins's performance opposite Julie Walters received good reviews and he contributed four songs to the film's soundtrack. His slow ballad rendition of \"A Groovy Kind of Love\", originally a 1966 single by The Mindbenders, became his only single to reach No. 1 in both the U.S. and the UK. The film also spawned the hit single Two Hearts, which he co-wrote with legendary Motown songwriter Lamont Dozier; the two artists would go on to win a Golden Globe for Best Original Song and receive an Oscar nomination in the same category, the second such honour for Collins; \"Big Noise\", written by Phil Collins and Lamont Dozier, which included Collins on the lead vocals (although the song was not released as a single, an instrumental version of this song appeared as the B-side to the single version of \"A Groovy Kind of Love\"). The final song, \"Loco in Acapulco\", was another collaboration with Dozier, with the vocals performed by the legendary Motown group The Four Tops. Film critic Roger Ebert said the role of Buster was \"played with surprising effectiveness\" by Collins, although the film's soundtrack proved more successful than the film did.",

Hadley is recognisable for his suave image,  as well as his powerful blue-eyed soul voice, which has been described by AllMusic as a \"dramatic warble\".  He has also been characterised as a \"top crooner\" by the BBC.  \n\nEarly life\n\nAnthony Patrick Hadley was born the eldest of three children at Royal Free Hospital in the Hampstead area of Inner London. He has a sister, Lee, and a brother, Steve. His father, Patrick Hadley, worked as an electrical engineer for the Daily Mail, and his mother, Josephine, worked for the local health authority.  Hadley attended Dame Alice Owen\u2019s Grammar School in England.\n\nSpandau Ballet\n\nSpandau Ballet was formed in 1976 as The Cut, with Gary Kemp, Steve Norman, John Keeble, Michael Ellison and Tony Hadley, all of whom were students at the same grammar school. As a member of Spandau Ballet, Hadley went on to enjoy international success in the 1980s, including hits such as \"True\", \"Gold\" and \"Through the Barricades\", as well as appearing at Live Aid in 1985.  Spandau Ballet disbanded in 1989 after their final studio album, Heart Like a Sky, failed to live up to the critical and commercial success of their earlier albums, such as True and Parade. Heart Like a Sky was not released in the United States.\nEarly synthpop has been described as \"eerie, sterile, and vaguely menacing\", using droning electronics with little change in inflection. Later the introduction of dance beats made the music warmer and catchier and contained within the conventions of three-minute pop.. Duran Duran, who emerged from the Birmingham scene, have been credited with incorporating a dance-orientated rhythm section into synthpop to produce a catchier and warmer sound, which provided them with a series of hit singles.\n\nOf groups associated with the New Romantic movement, Culture Club avoided a total reliance on synthesizers, producing a sound that combined elements of Motown, the Philly sound and lovers rock.Simon Reynolds, Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978\u20131984 (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), ISBN 0-571-21570-X, pp. 412\u20133.

    "question": "What was the surname of the butler played by Gordon Jackson in Upstairs Downstairs?",
    "answer": "Hudson",
    "evidence": "The best-known fictional manservant, and the prototype of the quintessential British butler, is himself not a butler at all. Reginald Jeeves, the iconic creation of author P. G. Wodehouse is a \"gentleman's gentleman\" and general factotum. Probably the best-known fictional butlers are Alfred from the Batman comic and films; Hudson of Upstairs, Downstairs television fame; Mr Carson from the Downton Abbey television series; and Crichton from J. M. Barrie's The Admirable Crichton. Lesser-knowns include Mr. Belvedere from the novel Belvedere, which was adapted into a feature film with sequels and later a television series; Lurch, from the television series The Addams Family, based on Charles Addams' The New Yorker cartoons; Beach, from the Wodehouse series about Blandings Castle; Niles, the butler at the Sheffield house in American sitcom The Nanny, and Benson from the two series Soap and Benson.\n\nNot all fictional butlers portray the \"butler stereotype\", however. Alan Bates, who played the butler Jennings in the film Gosford Park, was coached in brooding detail by Arthur Inch, a longtime real-life butler.   Mr. Stevens, the butler played by Anthony Hopkins in the film Remains of the Day, was also acted with remarkable realism. A female butler, Sarah Stevens, is the principal character in Linda Howard's 2002 Dying to Please, a murder/romance novel. Howard gives detailed and generally accurate descriptions of butlering in the work. \n\nExamples\nIn the 1950s and 1960s he appeared on television in programmes such as The Adventures of Robin Hood, ABC of Britain, Gideon's Way and The Avengers. In 1955 he had a small part in The Quatermass Xperiment, the film version of the BBC TV serial. He later had supporting roles in the films The Great Escape, The Bridal Path and The Ipcress File. In 1969, he and his wife had important roles in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. That year, he played Horatio in Tony Richardson's production of Hamlet and he won a Clarence Derwent Award for Best Supporting Actor, having also taken part in the film version.\n\nGordon Jackson became a household name playing the stern Scottish butler Hudson in sixty episodes of the period drama Upstairs, Downstairs from 1971 to 1975. In 1976, he won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor for the episode \"The Beastly Hun\". In 1974, he was named British Actor of the Year and in 1979 he was made an OBE. Jackson was cast opposite Bette Davis for the American television film Madame Sin (1972), which was released in overseas markets as a feature film.\n\nHis next big television role was in The Professionals from 1977. He played George Cowley in all 57 episodes until the programme's end in 1983, although filming had finished in 1981. He played Noel Strachan in the Australian World War II drama A Town Like Alice (1981), winning a Logie Award for his performance.\nMany writers wrote episodes throughout the five series, including Alfred Shaughnessy, John Hawkesworth, Fay Weldon, Terence Brady and Charlotte Bingham, John Harrison, Julian Bond, Raymond Bowers, Jeremy Paul, Rosemary Anne Sisson, Anthony Skene and Elizabeth Jane Howard.\n\nProduction \n\nEach episode of Upstairs, Downstairs was made in a fortnightly production schedule. The book \"Inside Updown\" has a very detailed production history.  The first week and a half would be spent rehearsing, with two days in the studio - the latter part of the second day being used for recording.  Location footage was usually shot beforehand. The exterior shots of 165 Eaton Place were filmed at 65 Eaton Place with the \"1\" painted on. Upstairs, Downstairs was one of the first major colour productions to be made by LWT. Interior sequences were first recorded in LWT's first studio production area in Wembley in London, for all of series one and the episode \"A Pair of Exiles\" in series two. For the rest of series two and for the remaining three series the interior sequences were recorded in LWT's brand new studio complex called Kent House, or as it is known today The London Studios on London's Southbank. \n\nHerne Bay, features in series three, episode thirteen \u201cThe Sudden Storm\u201d, when the staff take a day out to the seaside. \n\nAwards \n\nUpstairs, Downstairs was nominated for and won many national and international awards, winning two BAFTA awards, two Royal Television Society awards, three Writers Guild Awards, eight Emmys, and a Golden Globe.  It was nominated for a further seven BAFTAs, nine Emmys and four Golden Globes.  It was nominated for the BAFTA Television Award for Best Drama Series in 1972, 1973, 1975, and 1976, winning in 1972 and 1974.

He immediately began putting the Hermitage in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son, Andrew Jr. Although he suffered ill health, Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics. He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, \"I will die with the Union.\"  Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement. Jackson continued to denounce the \"perfidy and treachery\" of banks and urged his successor, Martin Van Buren to repudiate the Specie Circular.\n\nJackson's strong position in favor of the annexation of the Republic of Texas led him to support James K. Polk for the Democratic nomination in the 1844 presidential election against Calhoun and Van Buren.

    "question": "In which country are the Angel Falls, the highest waterfall in the world?",
    "answer": "Venezuela",
    "evidence": "The official height of the falls was determined by a survey carried out by an expedition organized and financed by American journalist Ruth Robertson on 13 May 1949.  The first known attempt to climb the face of the cliff was made in 1968 during the wet season. It failed because of slippery rock. In 1969, a second attempt was made during the dry season. This attempt was thwarted by lack of water and an overhang 400 ft from the top. The first climb to the top of the cliff was completed on 13 January 1971. The climbers required nine and a half days to ascend and one and a half days to rappel down. \n\nTourism\n\nAngel Falls is one of Venezuela's top tourist attractions, though a trip to the falls is a complicated affair. The falls are located in an isolated jungle. A flight from Puerto Ordaz or Ciudad Bol\u00edvar is required to reach Canaima camp, the starting point for river trips to the base of the falls. River trips generally take place from June to December, when the rivers are deep enough for use by the Pemon guides. During the dry season (December to March) there is less water seen than in the other months.\n\nIn popular media\n\nAngel Falls also inspired the setting of the Disney animated film Up (2009) although, in the film, the location was called Paradise Falls instead of Angel Falls. It also makes a small appearance in the Disney film Dinosaur, as well as the 1990 film Arachnophobia.

    "evidence": "We're No Angels is a 1955 Christmas comedy film starring an ensemble cast of Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, Aldo Ray, Joan Bennett, Basil Rathbone, and Leo G. Carroll. Shot in both  VistaVision and Technicolor, the Paramount Studios production was directed by Michael Curtiz, who had directed Bogart in Casablanca when both were under contract to Warner Brothers. It is one of Bogart's rare comedies.\n\nThe screenplay was written by Ranald MacDougall, based on the play My Three Angels by Samuel and Bella Spewack, which itself was based upon the French play La Cuisine Des Anges by Albert Husson. Mary Grant designed the film's costumes.\n\nPlot\n\nThree convicts \u2013 Joseph, Albert and Jules \u2013 escape from prison on Devil's Island just before Christmas and arrive at a nearby French colonial town. They go to a store managed by the Ducotel family, the only one to give supplies on credit. While there, they notice its roof is leaking, and offer to fix it. They do not actually intend to, but decide to remain there until nightfall, when they will steal clothes and supplies and escape on a ship waiting in the harbor. As they wait, they find that the small family of Felix, Amelie, and daughter Isabelle, is in financial distress and offer their services to hide the trio's all-too-sinister ruse. Joseph even gets to work conning people and falsifying records to make the store prosperous.  However, the three felons begin to have a change of heart after they fix a delicious Christmas dinner for the Ducotels made mostly of stolen items.\nAfter the war, he began writing; his first major success was with the play The Love of Four Colonels (1951). He starred with Humphrey Bogart and Aldo Ray in We're No Angels (1955). His career as a dramatist continued, his best-known play being Romanoff and Juliet (1956). His film roles include Roman emperor Nero in Quo Vadis (1951), Lentulus Batiatus in Spartacus (1960), Captain Vere in Billy Budd (1962), and an old man surviving a totalitarian future in Logan's Run (1976). Ustinov voiced the anthropomorphic lions Prince John and King Richard in the 1973 Disney animated film Robin Hood. He also worked on several films as writer and occasionally director, including The Way Ahead (1944), School for Secrets (1946), Hot Millions (1968), and Memed, My Hawk (1984).\n\nIn half a dozen films, he played Agatha Christie's famous detective Hercule Poirot, first in Death on the Nile (1978) and then in 1982's Evil Under the Sun, 1985's Thirteen at Dinner (TV movie), 1986's Dead Man's Folly (TV movie), 1986's Murder In Three Acts (TV movie), and 1988's Appointment with Death.\n\nUstinov won Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor for his roles in Spartacus (1960) and Topkapi (1964). He also won one Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor for the film Quo Vadis (he set the Oscar and Globe statuettes up on his desk as if playing doubles tennis; the game was a love of his life, as was ocean yachting). Ustinov was also the winner of three Emmys and one Grammy, and was nominated for two Tony Awards.\nIn 1955, Ray featured in starring roles in Battle Cry, Three Stripes in the Sun, and one of his best-loved films, We're No Angels (1955), in which he starred with Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, Basil Rathbone, Leo G. Carroll, and Joan Bennett. In 1956, in between appearances in Three Stripes In The Sun and Men in War, Ray tried his hand at radio, working as a personality and announcer at Syracuse, New York hit music station WNDR. A photo of Ray with a colleague in the WNDR studios, taken as part of a station promotional package, survives and can be found on a WNDR tribute website, although it's not known if any aircheck tapes of his radio shows still exist. By 1957, in any event, he had left WNDR and the radio business and returned to Hollywood. He would appear in 11 films during the following 11 years (1957\u201368), the busiest period of his film career. \n\nOn January 31, 1957, Ray appeared on NBC's The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford. He and Tennessee Ernie Ford did a comedy skit from a foxhole. \n\nHe also appeared on an episode of Bonanza \"The Wild One\" as a horse wrangler, October 4, 1964\n\nAuthor Richard Matheson said that his best-known work, The Incredible Shrinking Man, was inspired by a scene in Aldo Ray's Let's Do It Again in which a character puts on someone else's hat and it sinks down past his ears; \"I thought, what if a man put on his own hat and that happened?\" he recounted in an interview for Stephen King's non fiction work Danse Macabre.",

As discussed in Lerner's 1978 book, The Street Where I Live, Frederick Loewe, who initially had no interest in the project, agreed to write music, with the understanding that if things went badly, it would be his last score.  After the tremendous success of My Fair Lady, expectations were high for a new Lerner and Loewe musical. However, the show's production met several obstacles. Lerner's wife left him during the writing process,  causing him to seek medical attention and delaying the production. When Camelot began rehearsals, it still needed considerable work. However, the producers were able to secure a strong cast, including Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, and Roddy McDowall, as well as Robert Goulet in his first Broadway role. John Cullum also made his Broadway debut as Sir Dinadan; Bruce Yarnell was Sir Lionel. Cullum later replaced McDowall, and William Squire replaced Burton.

The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a Viceroyalty with its capital in Lima, which included most of its South American colonies. Ideas of political autonomy later spread throughout Spanish America and Peru gained its independence, which was formally proclaimed in 1821. After the battle of Ayacucho, three years after proclamation,  Peru ensured its independence. After achieving independence, the country remained in recession and kept a low military profile until an economic rise based on the extraction of raw and maritime materials struck the country, which ended shortly before the war of the Pacific. Subsequently, the country has undergone changes in government from oligarchic to democratic systems. Peru has gone through periods of political unrest and internal conflict as well as periods of stability and economic upswing.\n\nPeru is a representative democratic republic divided into 25 regions. It is a developing country with a high Human Development Index score and a poverty level around 25.8 percent.  Its main economic activities include mining, manufacturing, agriculture and fishing.\nSovereignty was only attained after Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, aided by Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez and Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, won the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821. On 24 July 1823, Jos\u00e9 Prudencio Padilla and Rafael Urdaneta helped seal Venezuelan independence with their victory in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo.  New Granada's congress gave Bol\u00edvar control of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded Gran Colombia.\n\nSucre, who won many battles for Bol\u00edvar, went on to liberate Ecuador and later become the second president of Bolivia. Venezuela remained part of Gran Colombia until 1830, when a rebellion led by P\u00e1ez allowed the proclamation of a newly independent Venezuela; P\u00e1ez became the first president of the new republic.  Between one-quarter and one-third of Venezuela's population was lost during these two decades of warfare  which by 1830 was estimated at about 800,000. \n\nThe colors of the Venezuelan flag are yellow, blue, and red: the yellow stands for land wealth, the blue for the sea that separates Venezuela from Spain, and the red for the blood shed by the heroes of independence. \n\nSlavery in Venezuela was abolished in 1854. Much of Venezuela's 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule,  including the Independence leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez, who gained the presidency three times and served a total of 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the Federal War (1859\u20131863), a civil war in which hundreds of thousands died, in a country with a population of not much more than a million people. In the latter half of the century, Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco, another caudillo, served a total of 13 years between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents interspersed.",

    "question": "The left side of the heart pumps blood to all parts of the body, but the right side pumps blood to which organ in particular?",
    "answer": "The lungs",
    "evidence": "The heart pumps blood through the body. Blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation\u2212where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. In addition the blood carries nutrients from the digestive tract to various organs of the body, while transporting waste to the liver and kidneys. Normally with each heartbeat  the right ventricle pumps the same amount of blood into the lungs as the left ventricle pumps to the body. Veins transport blood to the heart and carry deoxygenated blood - except for the pulmonary and portal veins. Arteries transport blood away from the heart, and apart from the pulmonary artery hold oxygenated blood. Their increased distance from the heart cause veins to have lower pressures than arteries. The heart contracts at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.\n\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths.  Of these more than three quarters follow coronary artery disease and stroke.  Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others.  Diagnosis of CVD is often done by listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG or by ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.\n\nStructure\n\nLocation and shape\nPhysiology\n\nCardiovascular system\n\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In humans, blood is pumped from the strong left ventricle of the heart through arteries to peripheral tissues and returns to the right atrium of the heart through veins. It then enters the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism by cells, to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.\n\nAdditional return flow may be generated by the movement of skeletal muscles, which can compress veins and push blood through the valves in veins toward the right atrium.\n\nThe blood circulation was famously described by William Harvey in 1628. \n\nProduction and degradation of blood cells\nMammals such as humans have a variety of organ systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in human anatomy.\n* Cardiovascular system: pumping and channeling blood to and from the body and lungs with heart, blood and blood vessels.\n* Digestive system: digestion and processing food with salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, colon, rectum and anus.\n* Endocrine system: communication within the body using hormones made by endocrine glands such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, pineal body or pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroids and adrenals, i.e., adrenal glands.\n* Excretory system: kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra involved in fluid balance, electrolyte balance and excretion of urine.\n* Lymphatic system: structures involved in the transfer of lymph between tissues and the blood stream, the lymph and the nodes and vessels that transport it including the Immune system: defending against disease-causing agents with leukocytes, tonsils, adenoids, thymus and spleen.\n* Integumentary system: skin, hair and nails.\n* Muscular system: movement with muscles.\n* Nervous system: collecting, transferring and processing information with brain, spinal cord and nerves.\n* Reproductive system: the sex organs, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, mammary glands, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis.\n* Respiratory system: the organs used for breathing, the pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs and diaphragm.\n* Skeletal system: structural support and protection with bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons.\n\nOther animals\n\nThe organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more advanced phyla. The less-advanced taxons (like Placozoa, Porifera and Radiata) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs.\n\nPlants",

    "question": "In what year did Edward Vlll abdicate?",
    "answer": "1936",
    "evidence": "Edward's supporters felt that he had \"been hounded from the throne by that arch humbug Baldwin\",  but many members of the establishment were relieved by Edward's departure. Mackenzie King wrote in his diary on 8 December 1936 that Edward's \"sense of right or wrong has been largely obliterated by the jazz of life he has led for years\" and, upon receiving news of Edward's final decision to abdicate, \"if that is the kind of man he is it is better he should not be longer on the Throne.\"  Edward's own Assistant Private Secretary, Alan Lascelles, had told Baldwin as early as 1927: \"I can't help thinking that the best thing that could happen to him, and to the country, would be for him to break his neck.\" \n\nOn 11 December 1936, Edward made a BBC radio broadcast from Windsor Castle; having abdicated, he was introduced by Sir John Reith as \"His Royal Highness Prince Edward\".   The official address had been polished by Churchill and was moderate in tone, speaking about Edward's inability to do his job \"as I would have wished\" without the support of \"the woman I love\".  Edward's reign had lasted 327\u00a0days, the shortest of any British monarch since the disputed reign of Lady Jane Grey over 380\u00a0years earlier. The day following the broadcast he left Britain for Austria.\n\nPost-abdication\n\nGeorge VI gave his elder brother the title of Duke of Windsor with the style His Royal Highness on 12 December 1936.  On 3 May the following year, the Simpsons' divorce was made final. The case was handled quietly and it barely featured in some newspapers. The Times printed a single sentence below a separate, and seemingly unconnected, report announcing the Duke's departure from Austria.\nLetters Patent dated 27 May 1937 re-conferred the \"title, style, or attribute of Royal Highness\" upon the Duke of Windsor, but specifically stated that \"his wife and descendants, if any, shall not hold said title or attribute\". Some British ministers advised that the reconfirmation was unnecessary since Edward had retained the style automatically, and further that Simpson would automatically obtain the rank of wife of a prince with the style Her Royal Highness; others maintained that he had lost all royal rank and should no longer carry any royal title or style as an abdicated king, and be referred to simply as \"Mr Edward Windsor\". On 14 April 1937, Attorney General Sir Donald Somervell submitted to Home Secretary Sir John Simon a memorandum summarising the views of Lord Advocate T. M. Cooper, Parliamentary Counsel Sir Granville Ram, and himself:\n# We incline to the view that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be described as a Royal Highness. In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.\n# The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.\n# We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis. The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.",

Fatally shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy was traveling with his wife, Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally's wife, Nellie, in a presidential motorcade. A ten-month investigation from November 1963 to September 1964 by the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, and that Jack Ruby also acted alone when he killed Oswald before he could stand trial.  Kennedy's death marked the fourth and latest successful assassination of an American President. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson became President upon Kennedy's death,  taking the constitutionally prescribed  oath of office onboard Air Force One at Dallas's Love Field airport before departing for Washington, D.C.\n\nIn contrast to the conclusions of the Warren Commission, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded in 1979 that Kennedy was \"probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy\". The HSCA agreed with the Warren Commission in that Kennedy's and Connally's injuries were caused by Oswald's three rifle shots, but they also determined the existence of additional gunshots based on analysis of an audio recording and therefore \"... a high probability that two gunmen fired at [the] President\". The Committee was not able to identify any individuals or groups involved with the conspiracy. In addition, the HSCA found that the original federal investigations were \"seriously flawed\" in respect of information-sharing and the possibility of conspiracy. As recommended by the HSCA, the acoustic evidence indicating conspiracy was subsequently re-examined and rejected.\nLee Harvey Oswald (October 18, 1939 \u2013 November 24, 1963) was an American sniper who assassinated President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. According to five U.S. government investigations,These were investigations by: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1963), the Warren Commission (1964), the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979), the Secret Service, and the Dallas Police Department. Oswald shot and killed Kennedy as Kennedy traveled by motorcade through Dealey Plaza in the city of Dallas, Texas.\n\nOswald was a former U.S. Marine who defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959. He lived in the Belarusian city of Minsk until June 1962, at which time he returned to the United States with his Russian wife, eventually settling in Dallas.\n\nFollowing Kennedy's assassination, Oswald was initially arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit, who was killed on a Dallas street approximately 45 minutes after President Kennedy was shot. Oswald was later charged with the murder of Kennedy; he denied shooting anybody, saying that he was a patsy.

    "question": "Who killed Robert F Kennedy?",
    "answer": "Sirhan Sirhan",
    "evidence": "In 1968, Kennedy was a leading candidate  for the Democratic nomination for the presidency, appealing especially to poor, African-American, Hispanic, and Catholic voters. Shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, after defeating Senator Eugene McCarthy in the California presidential primary, he was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, and died the following day.\n\nEarly life\n\nRobert F. Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts, the seventh child of businessman/politician Joseph P. \"Joe\" Kennedy, Sr. (1888\u20131969) and philanthropist Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy (1890\u20131995).  His older brothers were Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. (1915\u20131944) and John F. \"Jack\" Kennedy (1917\u20131963), who was elected the 35th President of the United States in 1960. His younger brother was longtime United States Senator Edward M. \"Ted\" Kennedy (1932\u20132009).  All four of his grandparents were the children of immigrants from Ireland. \n\nHis father was a wealthy businessman, and a leading Irish Catholic figure in the Democratic Party. After he stepped down as ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1940, Joe, Sr. focused his attention on his first born, Joseph, Jr., planning that he would enter politics and be elected president. He also urged the younger children to examine and discuss current events in order to propel them to public service.  After Joseph, Jr. was killed during World War II, the senior Kennedy's hopes fell on his second son, John, to become president. Joseph, Sr. had the money and connections to play a central role in the family's political ambitions.\nThe assassination of Robert Francis \"Bobby\" Kennedy, a United States Senator and brother of assassinated President John Fitzgerald \"Jack\" Kennedy, took place shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, in Los Angeles, California, during the campaign season for the 1968 presidential election.\n\nAfter winning the California and South Dakota primary elections for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, Kennedy was fatally shot as he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel and died in the Good Samaritan Hospital twenty-six hours later. Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian/Jordanian immigrant, was convicted of Kennedy's murder and is serving a life sentence for the crime. The shooting was recorded on audio tape by a freelance newspaper reporter, and the aftermath was captured on film.\n\nKennedy's body lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York for two days before a funeral Mass was held on June 8. His body was interred near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery. His death prompted the protection of presidential candidates by the United States Secret Service. Hubert Humphrey later went on to win the Democratic nomination for the presidency, but ultimately lost the election to Republican Richard Nixon.\n\nAs with his brother John's death, Kennedy's assassination and the circumstances surrounding it have spawned a variety of conspiracy theories. Kennedy remains one of only two sitting United States Senators to be assassinated, the other being Huey Long.\n\nBackground\n\nKennedy visited the British Mandate of Palestine in 1948 and wrote dispatches at the time for the Boston Post about his trip and the effect it had on him when he was twenty-two years old.  During his stay, he wrote that he grew to admire the Jewish inhabitants of the area. As a Senator, he later became a strong supporter and advocate for Israel.\nA parole hearing for Sirhan is now scheduled every five years. \n\nOn March 2, 2011, after 42 years in prison, Sirhan's 14th parole hearing was held, with Sirhan represented by his current attorney, William Francis Pepper.  At this parole hearing, Sirhan testified that he continues to have no memory of the assassination nor of any details of his 1969 trial and confession.  Pepper also repeated the claim, which Sirhan's lawyers had previously stated, that Sirhan was \"hypno programmed\" and his memory of being programmed was \"wiped\" by an unknown conspiracy behind the assassination which is why Sirhan has no recall of the murder.  Pepper said he hired Dr. Daniel Brown of Harvard Medical School to spend more than sixty hours with Sirhan Sirhan in prison and recover his memory of both the shooting and having been put under hypnosis.  His parole was denied on the grounds that Sirhan still does not understand the full ramifications of his crime.",

    "evidence": "Jean-Paul Marat (; 24 May 1743\u00a0\u2013 13 July 1793) was a political theorist and amateur scientist  who became best known for his role as a radical journalist and politician during the French Revolution. His journalism became renowned for its fierce tone, uncompromising stance toward the new leaders and institutions of the revolution, and advocacy of basic human rights for the poorest members of society.\n\nMarat was one of the most radical voices of the French Revolution. He became a vigorous defender of the sans-culottes, publishing his views in pamphlets, placards and newspapers, notably his L'Ami du peuple (Friend of the People), which helped make him their unofficial link with the radical, republican Jacobin group that came to power after June 1793.\n\nMarat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday, a Girondist sympathizer, while taking a medicinal bath for his debilitating skin condition. In his death, Marat became an icon to the Jacobins as a revolutionary martyr, as portrayed in Jacques-Louis David's famous painting, The Death of Marat.  For this assassination, Corday was executed four days later, on 17 July 1793.\n\nLife, education and political involvement\nAftermath\n\nAfter Corday's decapitation, a man named Legros lifted her head from the basket and slapped it on the cheek. Charles-Henri Sanson, the executioner, indignantly rejected published reports that Legros was one of his assistants. Sanson stated in his diary that Legros was in fact a carpenter who had been hired to make repairs to the guillotine.  Witnesses report an expression of \"unequivocal indignation\" on her face when her cheek was slapped. The oft-repeated anecdote has served to suggest that victims of the guillotine may in fact retain consciousness for a short while, including by Albert Camus in his Reflections on the Guillotine (\"Charlotte Corday's severed head blushed, it is said, under the executioner's slap.\").  This offense against a woman executed moments before was considered unacceptable and Legros was imprisoned for three months because of his outburst. \n\nJacobin leaders had her body autopsied immediately after her death to see if she was a virgin. They believed there was a man sharing her bed and the assassination plans. To their dismay, she was found to be virgo intacta (a virgin). \n\nThe assassination did not stop the Jacobins or the Terror: Marat became a martyr, a bust of him replaced a religious statue on the rue aux Ours and a number of place-names were changed to incorporate his. \n\nCultural references",

    "question": "What was the name of the kangaroo often mistaken by Sylvester the cat to be a giant mouse?",
    "answer": "Hippety Hopper",
    "evidence": "Hippety Hopper is a young kangaroo cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes series of cartoons. Robert McKimson introduced Hippety Hopper in Hop, Look and Listen (1948), which established the pattern for future Hippety Hopper cartoons.\n\nHistory\n\nHippety Hopper cartoons have a typical formula: Hopper escapes from a zoo, circus, etc., and is mistaken for a giant mouse by Sylvester the cat. Frequently, Hopper changes places with an actual mouse, generally when it is most embarrassing for Sylvester. Sylvester tries to capture and eat his \"prey\", but the innocent and infantile Hippety mistakes Sylvester's predations for a game of rough-housing. Sylvester is repeatedly punched, kicked, juggled, spun, and pounced, but each failure only strengthens his desire to have the \"mouse\" for lunch. Hippety Hopper returns in McKimson's Pop 'Im Pop! (1950), in which proud papa Sylvester boasts of his mousing skills to his son, Sylvester Jr. In Cats A-Weigh! (1953), Sylvester Cat accepts a position as mouse-catcher on a ship. He encounters Hippety Hopper being shipped from Australia. Sylvester mistakes Hippety Hopper once again for a giant mouse, and the baby kangaroo promptly beats the cat soundly. Junior is mortified, but the true victim is Sylvester, humiliated by a mere \"mouse\" in front of his own son.\n\nMcKimson would continue the Sylvester/Hippety Hopper series for 16 years, varying it slightly from cartoon to cartoon. In Bell Hoppy (1954), for example, in a twist on \"belling the cat\", Sylvester must hang a bell around a mouse's neck in order to join the \"Loyal Order of Alley Cats and Mousing and Chowder Club\".\n\nIn Lighthouse Mouse, Sylvester must guard a lighthouse from the baby kangaroo and a mouse who wants nothing more than to turn it off.",

    "question": "Gjetost is the national cheese of which country?",
    "answer": "Norway",
    "evidence": "Varieties\n\nIn Norway Brunost is commonly divided into two types: The ones that only contain cow's cream and/or milk, and the ones that contain some proportion of goat's milk. The latter type is commonly called Geitost or Gjetost (meaning \"Goat's Cheese\"). Varieties that do not contain any cow's milk are called Ekte Geitost (\"True Goat's Cheese\"). Technically, the term \"True Goat's Cheese\" is misleading, since genuine goat's cheese (such as the french Ch\u00e8vre) is relatively uncommon in Norway, and is commonly called Hvit geitost (\"White Goat's Cheese\") to avoid confusion.\n\nBy far the most popular variety is the Gudbrandsdalsost, which contains a mixture of cow and goat milk, cream and whey. In Norway it is in fact so common, that people just refer to it as \"Brunost\" or \"Geitost\", assuming that unless otherwise specified, Gudbrandsdalsost will be provided. This variety is also the most popular internationally, and in the USA it is commonly referred to just as \"Gjetost\". The second most popular variety is the Fl\u00f8temysost, which has a milder taste due to the lack of goat's milk. The third most popular type is the Ekte geitost.\n\nRelated to brunost are Prim (in Norwegian) or Messm\u00f6r (in Swedish), which is a soft, sweet spread commonly sold in tubes all across the Nordic countries. This is the original, ancient product made by boiling whey for a shorter period of time than brunost, and not adding milk or cream. Also, in Norway, pultost is traditionally made from by-products of the brunost-making process, and has a very distinctive flavour.\n\nUsage",

    "question": "A youngberry is a cross between a dewberry and what else?",
    "answer": "A blackberry",
    "evidence": "Youngberry is a complex hybrid between three different species from the genus Rubus, the raspberries, blackberries, and dewberries of the rose family. The berries of the plant are eaten fresh or used to make juice, jam, etc.\n\nByrnes M. Young, a businessman in Morgan City, Louisiana, who loved science and plants, had an ongoing correspondence with Luther Burbank, who had created the 'Phenomenal' blackberry\u2013raspberry hybrid.  While he had no success growing either loganberries (another blackberry-raspberry hybrid) or 'Phenomenal' berries, Young crossed the 'Phenomenal'  with the Austin-Mayes dewberry that was better adapted to his area. This produced \u2018Youngberry\u2019 in 1905, which was then released in 1926.\n\nWhile the youngberry is not grown much in the U.S., it is grown in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa and was a parent of the commercially successful olallie blackberry and a grandparent of the marionberry.\n\nLike its 'Phenomenal' parent, it is a hexaploid.\nThe dewberries are a group of species in the genus Rubus, section Rubus, closely related to the blackberries. They are small trailing (rather than upright or high-arching) brambles with aggregate fruits, reminiscent of the raspberry, but are usually purple to black instead of red. Unlike many other Rubus species, dewberries have separate male and female plants (they are dioecious). \n\nDewberries are common throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere, sometimes thought of as a nuisance weed, but the leaves can be used for a tea, and the berries are sweet and edible. They can be eaten raw, or used to make cobbler, jam, or pie.\n\nAround March and April, the plants start to grow white flowers that develop into small green berries.  The tiny green berries grow red and then a deep purple-blue as they ripen. When the berries are ripe, they are tender and difficult to pick in any quantity without squashing them. The plants do not have upright canes like some other Rubus species, but have stems that trail along the ground, putting forth new roots along the length of the stem. The stems are covered with fine spines or stickers. The berries are sweet and, for many, less seedy than blackberries and worth the scratches and stains that come from picking them. \n\nIn the winter the leaves often remain on the stems, but may turn dark red. The leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including peach blossom moths.\n\nThe European dewberry, Rubus caesius, grows more upright like other brambles, but is frequently restricted to coastal communities, especially sand dune systems. Its fruits are a deep, almost black, purple and are coated with a thin layer or 'dew' of waxy droplets. Thus, they appear sky-blue (caesius is Latin for pale blue). It is less sought after, because its fruits are small and retain a markedly tart taste even when fully ripe.",

    "question": "Who is Arthur Wellesley better known as?",
    "answer": "Duke of Wellington",
    "evidence": "Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington,  (1 May 1769 \u2013 14 September 1852), was an Anglo-Irish soldier and statesman, and one of the leading military and political figures of 19th-century Britain. His defeat of Napol\u00e9on at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 put him in the top rank of Britain's military heroes. In 2002, he was number 14 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.\n\nWellington was born in Dublin, belonging to the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. He was commissioned as an ensign in the British Army in 1787, serving in Ireland as aide-de-camp to two successive Lords Lieutenant of Ireland. He was also elected as a Member of Parliament in the Irish House of Commons. He was a colonel by 1796, and saw action in the Netherlands and in India, where he fought in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War at the Battle of Seringapatam. He was appointed governor of Seringapatam and Mysore in 1799 and, as a newly appointed major-general, won a decisive victory over the Maratha Confederacy at the Battle of Assaye in 1803.\n\nWellesley rose to prominence as a general during the Peninsular campaign of the Napoleonic Wars, and was promoted to the rank of field marshal after leading the allied forces to victory against the French at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813. Following Napoleon's exile in 1814, he served as the ambassador to France and was granted a dukedom. During the Hundred Days in 1815, he commanded the allied army which defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, together with a Prussian army under Bl\u00fccher. Wellesley's battle record is exemplary; he ultimately participated in some 60 battles during the course of his military career.\n\nWellington is famous for his adaptive defensive style of warfare,  resulting in several victories against a numerically superior force while minimising his own losses. He is regarded as one of the greatest defensive commanders of all time, and many of his tactics and battle plans are still studied in military academies around the world.",

    "answer": "Battle",
    "evidence": "Settlements\n\nThe location of settlements in East Sussex has been determined both by its history and its geography. The original towns and villages tended to be where its economy lay: fishing  along the coast and agriculture and iron mining on the Weald. Industry today tends to be geared towards tourism, and particularly along the coastal strip. Here towns such as Bexhill-on-Sea, Eastbourne, and Hastings lie. Newhaven and Rye are ports, although the latter is also of historical importance. Peacehaven and Seaford are more dormitory towns than anything else. Away from the coast lie former market towns such as Hailsham, Heathfield and Uckfield; Crowborough is a centre for the Ashdown Forest. Lewes, the County town of East Sussex; and Battle, with its Norman Conquest beginnings. are the other two towns of significance.\n\nEconomy and demography\n\nThis is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex (Brighton & Hove has a separate table) at current basic prices [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/RegionalGVA.pdf published] (pp.\u00a0240\u2013253) by Office for National Statistics with figures in millions of British Pounds Sterling.\n\nPolitics\n\nLandmarks\n\nThe Seven Sisters Park is part of the South Downs National Park. Beachy Head is one of the most famed local attractions, along with the flats along Normans Bay.\n\nApart from the physical landmarks such as the Downs and the Weald, East Sussex has a great many landmarks of historical interest. There are castles at Bodiam, Herstmonceux, Lewes and Pevensey; and defence works such as the Martello towers and Eastbourne Redoubt.  Battle Abbey, built to commemorate the Battle of Hastings; Bateman's, home of Rudyard Kipling, Hammerwood Park, one of the first examples of Greek Revival architecture in the UK; and the University of Sussex buildings at Falmer are among interesting buildings.\n\nTransport\n\nRoads\nAftermath\n\nThe day after the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or marks on his body.  His personal standard was presented to William,Rex Harold II p. 253 and later sent to the papacy. The bodies of the English dead, including some of Harold's brothers and his housecarls, were left on the battlefield, although some were removed by relatives later.Gravett Hastings p. 81 The Norman dead were buried in a large communal grave, which has not been found. Exact casualty figures are unknown. Of the Englishmen known to be at the battle, the number of dead implies that the death rate was about 50 per cent of those engaged, although this may be too high. Of the named Normans who fought at Hastings, one in seven is stated to have died, but these were all noblemen, and it is probable that the death rate among the common soldiers was higher. Although Orderic Vitalis's figures are highly exaggerated, his ratio of one in four casualties may be accurate. Marren speculates that perhaps 2,000 Normans and 4,000 Englishmen were killed at Hastings.Marren 1066 pp. 147\u2013149 The Normans buried their dead in mass graves. Reports stated that some of the English dead were still being found on the hillside years later.

    "question": "Which 1986 Peter Weir movie and based on a Paul Theroux novel starred Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren and River Phoenix?",
    "answer": "The Mosquito Coast",
    "evidence": "It was followed by the darker, less commercial The Mosquito Coast (1986), Paul Schrader's adaptation of Paul Theroux's novel, with Ford playing a man obsessively pursuing his dream to start a new life in the Central American jungle with his family. These dramatic parts provided Harrison Ford with important opportunities to break the typecasting of his career-making roles in the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series. Both films showed off his ability to play more subtle and substantial characters and he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his work in Witness, the only Academy Awards recognition in his career. The Mosquito Coast is also notable for an impressive performance by the young River Phoenix.\n\nWeir's next film, Dead Poets Society, was a major international success, with Weir again receiving credit for expanding the acting range of its Hollywood star. Robin Williams was mainly known for his anarchic stand-up comedy and his popular TV role as the wisecracking alien in Mork & Mindy; in this film he played an inspirational teacher in a dramatic story about conformity and rebellion at an exclusive New England prep school in the 1950s. The film was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for Weir, it later won for Best Original Screenplay and launched the acting careers of young actors Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard. It became a major box-office hit and is one of Weir's best-known films to mainstream audiences.\n\nWeir's first romantic comedy Green Card (1990) was another casting risk. Weir chose French screen icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu in the lead\u2014Depardieu's first English-language role\u2014and paired him with American actress Andie MacDowell. Green Card was a box-office hit but was regarded as less of a critical success, although it helped Depardieu's path to international fame, and Weir received an Oscar nomination for his original screenplay.\nPaul Edward Theroux (born April 10, 1941) is an American travel writer and novelist, whose best-known work is The Great Railway Bazaar (1975). He has published numerous works of fiction, some of which were adapted as feature films. He was awarded the 1981 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel The Mosquito Coast, which was adapted for the 1986 movie of the same name.\n\nHe is the father of British authors and documentary makers Marcel Theroux and Louis Theroux, the brother of authors Alexander Theroux and Peter Theroux, and uncle of the American actor and screenwriter Justin Theroux.\n\nEarly life\n\nTheroux was born in Medford, Massachusetts, the son of Catholic parents; his mother, Anne (n\u00e9e Dittami), was Italian American, and his father, Albert Eugene Theroux, was French-Canadian.  His mother was a grammar school teacher and his father was a salesman for the American Leather Oak company.   Theroux was a Boy Scout and ultimately achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.\n\nTheroux was educated at Medford High School, followed by the University of Maine, in Orono (1959\u201360) and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he obtained a B.A. in English in 1963.\n\nAfter he finished his university education, Theroux joined the Peace Corps in 1963 as a teacher in Malawi. A new program, the Peace Corps had sent its first volunteers overseas in 1961.  Theroux helped a political opponent of Prime Minister Hastings Banda escape to Uganda.  For this Theroux was expelled from Malawi and thrown out of the Peace Corps. He was declared persona non grata by Banda in Malawi for sympathizing with Yatuta Chisiza.  As a consequence, his later novel Jungle Lovers, which concerns an attempted coup in the country, was banned in Malawi for many years. He moved to Uganda to teach at Makerere University, where he wrote for the magazine Transition.\nFord went on to star in the prequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) and the sequel Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). He returned to the role yet again for a 1993 episode of the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, and even later for the fourth film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). On March 15, 2016 Walt Disney Studios announced that Ford will appear in a fifth film due for release in July 2019. \n\nOther film work\n\nFord has been in other films, including Heroes (1977), Force 10 from Navarone (1978), and Hanover Street (1979). Ford also co-starred alongside Gene Wilder in the buddy-Western The Frisco Kid (1979), playing a bank robber with a heart of gold. He then starred as Rick Deckard in Ridley Scott's cult sci-fi classic Blade Runner (1982), and in a number of dramatic-action films: Peter Weir's Witness (1985) and The Mosquito Coast (1986), and Roman Polanski's Frantic (1988).\n\nThe 1990s brought Ford the role of Jack Ryan in Tom Clancy's Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994), as well as leading roles in Alan Pakula's Presumed Innocent (1990) and The Devil's Own (1997), Andrew Davis' The Fugitive (1993), Sydney Pollack's remake of Sabrina (1995), and Wolfgang Petersen's Air Force One (1997). Ford also played straight dramatic roles, including an adulterous husband in both Presumed Innocent (1990) and What Lies Beneath (2000), and a recovering amnesiac in Mike Nichols' Regarding Henry (1991).\n\nMany of Ford's major film roles came to him by default through unusual circumstances: he won the role of Han Solo while reading lines for other actors, was cast as Indiana Jones because Tom Selleck was not available, and took the role of Jack Ryan supposedly due to Alec Baldwin's fee demands, although Baldwin disputes this (Baldwin had previously played the role in The Hunt for Red October).\n\n1990s\u20132010s",

    "question": "What is the name of CS Lewis' 7 book fantasy?",
    "answer": "The Chronicles of Narnia",
    "evidence": "The Chronicles of Narnia\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels for children and is considered a classic of children's literature. Written between 1949 and 1954 and illustrated by Pauline Baynes, the series is Lewis's most popular work, having sold over 100 million copies in 41 languages  . It has been adapted several times, complete or in part, for radio, television, stage and cinema.\n\nThe books contain Christian ideas intended to be easily accessible to young readers. In addition to Christian themes, Lewis also borrows characters from Greek and Roman mythology, as well as traditional British and Irish fairy tales.\n\nOther works\n\nLewis wrote several works on Heaven and Hell. One of these, The Great Divorce, is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven, where they are met by people who dwell there. The proposition is that they can stay if they choose, in which case they can call the place where they had come from \"Purgatory\", instead of \"Hell\". But many find it not to their taste. The title is a reference to William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, a concept that Lewis found a \"disastrous error\" . This work deliberately echoes two other more famous works with a similar theme: the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, and Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress.\n\nAnother short work, The Screwtape Letters, consists of suave letters of advice from senior demon Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood on the best ways to tempt a particular human and secure his damnation. Lewis's last novel was Till We Have Faces, which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success. It is a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche from the unusual perspective of Psyche's sister. It is deeply concerned with religious ideas, but the setting is entirely pagan, and the connections with specific Christian beliefs are left implicit.\nPolitical and social trends can affect a society's reception towards fantasy. In the early 20th century, the New Culture Movement's enthusiasm for Westernization and science in China compelled them to condemn the fantastical shenmo genre of traditional Chinese literature. The spells and magical creatures of these novels were viewed as superstitious and backward, products of a feudal society hindering the modernization of China. Stories of the supernatural continued to be denounced once the Communists rose to power, and mainland China experienced a revival in fantasy only after the Cultural Revolution had ended. \n\nFantasy was a staple genre of pulp magazines published in the West. In 1923, the first all-fantasy fiction magazine, Weird Tales, was created. Many other similar magazines eventually followed, most noticeably The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. The pulp magazine format was at the height of its popularity at this time and was instrumental in bringing fantasy fiction to a wide audience in both the U.S. and Britain. Such magazines were also instrumental in the rise of science fiction, and it was at this time the two genres began to be associated with each other.\n\nBy 1950, \"sword and sorcery\" fiction had begun to find a wide audience, with the success of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian and Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories.  However, it was the advent of high fantasy, and most of all J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, which reached new heights of popularity in the late 1960s, that allowed fantasy to truly enter the mainstream.  Several other series, such as C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia and Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea books, helped cement the genre's popularity.",

His chase toward a runaway sniper in season premiere and his hunt to a rogue agent in episode 2 are not as quick and overwhelming in previous seasons. He also admits that the stabbing really shocked him, meaning that he has more concern on his safety now. Although, he admits he has a \"lost a step\" to his father, not remembering when he has beaten David or Colby in a sprint, he is quick enough to kill his old, tough FBI pal Pete \"Petey\" Fox, who is an expert in a gunfight and has fallen to the wrong side of the law. He grieves the loss of his adrenaline-chasing friend.  In response to a mid-life crisis sparked by his stabbing and the loss of Petey, Don buys a motorcycle.\nMidway through season six, he proposes to Robin.  She rejects his proposal, stating that she felt he is still in the middle of significant changes in his life.  She does promise to accept his proposal when he finds what he wants from life. In the sixth season finale, Don is at peace with himself after recovering his Glock, decides to take a head FBI position, and proposes once more to his now-fiancee Robin on his brother's wedding day. He promises to remain close with Charlie.\n\nCreation\n\nDon Eppes was created as Charlie's brother and as a link to the procedural part of the show.   Gabriel Macht originally was cast as Don Eppes in the original pilot of Numb3rs.   The believability of the family in terms of physical appearance and chemistry, however, created a need to recast the role.   Rob Morrow replaced Macht when Macht left the show.   At this point in development, Don was rewritten to be more intellectual than he was in the original pilot.  To prepare for his role as Don Eppes, Morrow did some training with the FBI as well as reading about and talking to real-life police officers.\n\nReception\nNumbers (stylized NUMB3RS) is an American crime drama television series that ran on CBS from January 23, 2005, to March 12, 2010. The series was created by Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, and follows FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) and his brother Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), a college mathematics professor and prodigy who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers Ridley and Tony Scott produced Numbers; its production companies are the Scott brothers' Scott Free Productions, CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Television, and later CBS Paramount Television).\n\nThe show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and mathematically modeled by Charlie, with the help of Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) and Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.\n\nIn May 2010, CBS announced that Numbers had been canceled after six seasons. \n\nCast and characters\n\nThe show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the FBI, scientists at the fictitious California Institute of Science (CalSci), and the Eppes family.",

    "question": "Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realised it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were",
    "answer": "Gone with the wind",
    "evidence": "Katie Scarlett O'Hara is a fictional character and the protagonist in Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel Gone with the Wind and in the later film of the same name. She also is the main character in the 1970 musical Scarlett and the 1991 book Scarlett, a sequel to Gone with the Wind that was written by Alexandra Ripley and adapted for a television mini-series in 1994. During early drafts of the original novel, Mitchell referred to her heroine as \"Pansy\", and did not decide on the name \"Scarlett\" until just before the novel went to print. \n\nBiography\n\nO'Hara is the oldest living child of Gerald and Ellen O'Hara. She was born on her family's plantation Tara in Georgia. She was named Katie Scarlett, after her father's mother, but is always called Scarlett, except by her father, who refers to her as \"Katie Scarlett.\" She is from a Catholic family of Irish and French ancestry, and a descendent of an aristocratic Savannah family on her mother's side (the Robillards). O'Hara has black hair, green eyes, and pale skin. She is famous for her fashionably small waist.  Scarlett has two younger sisters, Susan Elinor (\"Suellen\") O'Hara and Caroline Irene (\"Carreen\") O'Hara, and three little brothers who died in infancy. Her baby brothers are buried in the family burying ground at Tara, and each was named Gerald O'Hara, Jr.\n\nPersonality\n\nScarlett O'Hara is an atypical protagonist, especially as a female romantic lead in fiction. When the novel opens, Scarlett is sixteen. She is vain, self-centered, and very spoiled by her wealthy parents. She can also be insecure; but is very intelligent, despite her fashionable Southern-belle pretense at ignorance and helplessness around men. She is somewhat unique among Southern women, whom society preferred to act as dainty creatures who needed protection from their men. Scarlett is aware that she is only acting empty-headed, and resents the fashionable \"necessity\" of it, unlike most of her typical party-going Southern belles social set.\n...for her faithfulness and devotion, she has been immortalized in the literature of the South; so the memory of her will never pass, but live on in the tales that are told of those \"dear dead days beyond recall\".  \n\nMicki McElya, in her book, Clinging to Mammy, suggests the myth of the faithful slave, in the figure of Mammy, lingers because white Americans wish to live in a world where African Americans are not angry over the injustice of slavery. \n\nThe best-selling anti-slavery novel from the 19th century is Uncle Tom's Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, published in 1852.  Uncle Tom's Cabin is mentioned briefly in Gone with the Wind as being accepted by the Yankees as, \"revelation second only to the Bible\".  The enduring interest of both Uncle Tom's Cabin and Gone with the Wind has resulted in lingering stereotypes of 19th-century African American slaves.   However, since its publication, Gone with the Wind has become a reference point for subsequent writers about the South, both black and white alike. \n\nSouthern belle\n\nThe southern belle is an archetype for a young woman of the antebellum American South upper class. The southern belle's attractiveness is not only from physical beauty but rather lies in her charm. She is subject to the correct code of female behavior.

    "question": "Who is the patron saint of lost causes?",
    "answer": "St Jude",
    "evidence": "His feast day is October 28 (Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion and Lutheran Church) and June 19 (Eastern Orthodox Church).\n\nThe Order of Preachers (known better as the Dominicans) began working in present-day Armenia soon after their founding in 1216. At that time, there was already a substantial devotion to Saint Jude by both Catholic and Orthodox Christians in the area. This lasted until persecution drove Christians from the area in the 18th century. Devotion to Saint Jude began again in earnest in the 19th century, starting in Italy and Spain, spreading to South America, and finally to the United States (starting in the area around Chicago) owing to the influence of the Claretians and the Dominicans in the 1920s.\n\nPatronage\n\nAmong some Roman Catholics, Saint Jude is venerated as the \"patron saint of lost causes\". This practice stems from the belief that few Christians invoked him for misplaced fear of praying to Christ's betrayer, Judas Iscariot, because of their similar names. The ignored Jude thus became quite eager to assist anyone who sought his help, to the point of intervening in the most dire of circumstances. The Church also wanted to encourage veneration of this \"forgotten\" disciple, and maintained that Saint Jude would intervene in any lost cause to prove his sanctity and zeal for Christ.\n\nSaint Jude is the patron saint of the Chicago Police Department and of Clube de Regatas do Flamengo (a soccer team in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). His other patronages include desperate situations and hospitals. One of his namesakes is St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, which has helped many children with terminal illnesses and their families since its founding in 1962.\n\nPrayers\n\nA common Roman Catholic prayer to St Jude is:\n\nAn alternative prayer:\n\nNovena to Saint Jude (Novenas are a prayer said for nine consecutive days):\n\nShrines and churches\nAfter the deaths of her husband and sons, Rita desired to enter the monastery of Saint Mary Magdalene in Cascia but was turned away. Although the convent acknowledged Rita's good character and piety, the nuns were afraid of being associated with her due to the scandal of her husband's violent death. However, she persisted in her cause and was given a condition before the convent could accept her: the task of reconciling her family with her husband's murderers. She implored her three patron saints (John the Baptist, Augustine of Hippo, and Nicholas of Tolentino) to assist her, and she set about the task of establishing peace between the hostile parties of Cascia. Popular religious tales recall that the bubonic plague, which ravaged Italy at the time, infected Bernardo Mancini, causing him to relinquish his desire to feud any longer with the Chiqui family. She was able to resolve the conflicts between the families and, at the age of thirty-six, was allowed to enter the monastery.[http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/rita_di_cascia.pdf St. Rita di Cascia] from Fr. Alban Butler's [http://www.bartleby.com/210/ Lives of the Saints]\n\nPious Catholic legends later recount that she was transported into the monastery of Saint Magdalene via levitation at night into the garden courtyard by her three patron saints. She remained at the monastery, living by the Augustinian Rule, until her death from tuberculosis on May 22, 1457.[http://www.osa-west.org/saintrita.html Rotelle, John.

    "evidence": "Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Peter Benchley's 1974 novel of the same name. In the story, a giant man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers on Amity Island, a fictional New England summer resort town, prompting the local police chief to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist and a professional shark hunter. The film stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint, Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Murray Hamilton as Larry Vaughn, the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. The screenplay is credited to both Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography.\n\nShot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks suffered many malfunctions, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures gave the film what was then an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture, over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.",

    "evidence": "A little black dress (LBD) is a black evening or cocktail dress, cut simply and often quite short. Fashion historians ascribe the origins of the little black dress to the 1920s designs of Coco Chanel and Jean Patou  intended to be long-lasting, versatile, affordable, accessible to the widest market possible and in a neutral colour. Its ubiquity is such that it is often simply referred to as the \"LBD\".   \n\nThe \"little black dress\" is considered essential to a complete wardrobe by many women and fashion observers, who believe it a \"rule of fashion\" that every woman should own a simple, elegant black dress that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion: for example, worn with a jacket and pumps for daytime business wear or with more ornate jewelry and accessories for evening. Because it is meant to be a staple of the wardrobe for a number of years, the style of the little black dress ideally should be as simple as possible: a short black dress that is too clearly part of a trend would not qualify because it would soon appear dated. \n\nHistory",

    "question": "Which part of the human body produces insulin?",
    "answer": "The pancreas",
    "evidence": "Evidence of impaired first-phase insulin release can be seen in the glucose tolerance test, demonstrated by a substantially elevated blood glucose level at 30 minutes after the ingestion of a glucose load (75 or 100 g of glucose), followed a slow drop over the next 100 minutes, to remain above 120\u00a0mg/100 ml after two hours after the start of the test. In a normal person the blood glucose level is corrected (and may even be slightly over-corrected) by the end of the test.\n\nOscillations \n\nEven during the digestion, in general, one or two hours following a meal, insulin release from the pancreas is not continuous, but oscillates with a period of 3\u20136\u00a0minutes, changing from generating a blood insulin concentration more than about 800 pmol/l to less than 100 pmol/l.  This is thought to avoid downregulation of insulin receptors in target cells, and to assist the liver in extracting insulin from the blood. This oscillation is important to consider when administering insulin-stimulating medication, since it is the oscillating blood concentration of insulin release, which should, ideally, be achieved, not a constant high concentration. This may be achieved by delivering insulin rhythmically to the portal vein or by islet cell transplantation to the liver. It is hoped that future insulin pumps will address this characteristic. (See also Pulsatile Insulin.)\n\nBlood content \n\nThe blood content of insulin can be measured in international units, such as \u00b5IU/mL or in molar concentration, such as pmol/L, where 1 \u00b5IU/mL equals 6.945 pmol/L.  A typical blood level between meals is 8\u201311 \u03bcIU/mL (57\u201379 pmol/L). \n\nSignal transduction",

George Clooney's removal from the main cast opening credits was in the 16th episode of season 5.\n\nPlot\n\nDoug Ross was raised by his mother, Sarah, after his father, Ray, abandoned their family. In Season 1, he revealed to a patient that he had a son, and he tells nurse Wendy that he doesn't know his son's name as he's never seen him. Not much else is known about Doug's past. Despite his jumbled personal life, Ross is a dedicated ER pediatrician. He has always been committed to medicine and children and to helping no matter what the rules or consequences. During Season 2, Doug rescued a boy trapped in a flooding storm drain during a rainstorm. His heroic efforts were filmed on local television, making him a media star. This event helped him earn back his job at County, because his supervisor in pediatrics originally wasn't going to renew his fellowship on account of his disrespect to authority.\n\nDuring Season 2, Ray, Ross' father, tries to reconcile with his estranged son. Ross has difficulty reconnecting with the man who abandoned him and his mother. Ray owns a ritzy hotel in Chicago, and Doug lets his guard down a little, but is disappointed  when his father offers to take him to a Chicago Bulls game and then stands him up. Ross later reveals the reason that  he and his mother were abused by his father. Doug later has an affair with Ray's girlfriend, a woman who Ray stole money from, but ends the relationship when it becomes clear she has a lot of problems. \n\nRoss is a womanizer who dates and leaves many women throughout the course of the show. His womanizing days come to an abrupt end after a one-night stand with an epileptic woman who hides her condition and dies in the ER. Ross never knew her name until after she dies, after which he stops dating for a while until he gets back together with Carol Hathaway, the head nurse of the ER at County.\nDue to the show launching on NBC at the same time that CBS launched its own medical drama Chicago Hope, many critics drew comparisons between the two. Eric Mink concluded that ER may rate more highly in the Nielsens but Chicago Hope told better stories, while Rich felt both shows were \"riveting, superior TV fare.\" The Daily Telegraph wrote in 1996: \"Not being able to follow what on earth is going on remains one of the peculiar charms of the breakneck American hospital drama, ER\". \n\nIn 2002, TV Guide ranked ER No. 22 on their list of \"TV's Top 50 Shows\", making it the second highest ranked medical drama on the list (after St. Elsewhere at #20).

The show also placed No. 19 on Entertainment Weekly \"New TV Classics\" list.  British magazine Empire ranked it No. 29 in their list of the \"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\" and said the best episode was \"Hell And High Water\" (Season 2, Episode 7) where \"Doug Ross (George Clooney) saves a young boy from drowning during a flood.\"  In 2012, ER was voted Best TV Drama on ABC's 20/20 special episode \"Best in TV: The Greatest TV Shows of Our Time\".

The opening ceremony was held in a blizzard while warm weather conditions plagued sporting events throughout the rest of the Games.  Because of the weather the 10,000\u00a0metre speed-skating event had to be abandoned and officially cancelled.  The weather was not the only noteworthy aspect of the 1928 Games: Sonja Henie of Norway made history when she won the figure skating competition at the age of 15. She became the youngest Olympic champion in history, a distinction she would hold for 74\u00a0years.\n\nThe next Winter Olympics was the first to be hosted outside of Europe. Seventeen nations and 252 athletes participated.  This was less than in 1928 as the journey to Lake Placid, United States, was a long and expensive one for most competitors who had little money in the midst of the Great Depression. The athletes competed in fourteen events in four sports.  Virtually no snow fell for two months before the Games, and it was not until mid-January that there was enough snow to hold all the events.   Sonja Henie defended her Olympic title and Eddie Eagan, who had been an Olympic champion in boxing in 1920, won the gold in the men's bobsleigh event to become the first, and so far only, Olympian to have won gold medals in both the Summer and Winter Olympics.\n\nThe German towns of Garmisch and Partenkirchen joined to organise the 1936 edition of the Winter Games, held on 6\u201316 February.   This would be the last time the Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same country in the same year. Alpine skiing made its Olympic debut, but skiing teachers were barred from entering because they were considered to be professionals. Because of this decision the Swiss and Austrian skiers refused to compete at the Games.\n\nWorld War II\nSonja Henie (8 April 1912 \u2013 12 October 1969) was a Norwegian figure skater and film star. She was a three-time Olympic Champion (1928, 1932, 1936) in Ladies' Singles, a ten-time World Champion (1927\u20131936) and a six-time European Champion (1931\u20131936). Henie won more Olympic and World titles than any other ladies' figure skater. At the height of her acting career she was one of the highest paid stars in Hollywood. \n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nHenie was born in Kristiania, current Oslo, the only daughter of Wilhelm Henie (1872\u20131937), a prosperous Norwegian furrier, and his wife Selma Lochmann-Nielsen (1888\u20131961). In addition to the income from the fur business, both of Henie's parents had inherited wealth. Wilhelm Henie had been a one-time World Cycling Champion and the Henie children were encouraged to take up a variety of sports at a young age. Henie initially showed talent at skiing, and then followed her older brother Leif to take up figure skating. As a girl, Henie was also a nationally ranked tennis player and a skilled swimmer and equestrienne. Once Henie began serious training as a figure skater, her formal schooling ended. She was educated by tutors, and her father hired the best experts in the world, including the famous Russian ballerina Tamara Karsavina, to transform his daughter into a sporting celebrity. \n\nCompetitive career\n\nHenie won her first major competition, the senior Norwegian championships, at the age of 10.

It is a part of the Alpide belt in Eurasia.\n\nThe Taurus mountains are divided into three chains from west to east as follows;\n*Western Taurus (Bat\u0131 Toroslar)\n** Akda\u011flar, the Bey Mountains, Katranc\u0131k Mountain, Geyik Mountain\n*Central Taurus (Orta Toroslar)\n** Ak\u00e7al\u0131 Mountains, Bolkar Mountains, Anti-Taurus Mountains, Tahtal\u0131 Mountains, Aladaglar Mountain\n*Southeastern Taurus (G\u00fcneydo\u011fu Toroslar)\n** Nurhak Mountains, Malatya Mountains, Maden Mountains, Gen\u00e7 Mountains, Bitlis mountains\n\nHistory\n\nPre-history to early Roman period\n\nThe bull was commonly the symbol and depiction of ancient Near Eastern storm gods, hence Taurus the bull, and hence the name of the mountains. The mountains are a place of many ancient storm-god temples.  Torrential thunderstorms in these mountains were deemed by the ancient Syrians to be the work of the storm-god Adad to make the Tigris and Euphrates rivers rise and flood and thereby fertilise their land.   The Hurrians, probably originators of the various storm-gods of the ancient Near East, were a people whom modern scholars place in the Taurus Mountains at their probable earliest origins.\n\nA Bronze Age archaeological site, where early evidence of tin mining was found, is at Kestel.  The pass known in antiquity as the Cilician Gates crosses the range north of Tarsus.\nGeography \n\nSyria lies between latitudes 32\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 N, and longitudes 35\u00b0 and 43\u00b0 E. It consists mostly of arid plateau, although the northwest part of the country bordering the Mediterranean is fairly green. The Northeast of the country \"al-Jazira\" and the South \"Hawran\" are important agricultural areas.  The Euphrates, Syria's most important river, crosses the country in the east. It is considered to be one of the fifteen states that comprise the so-called \"Cradle of civilization\".  Its land straddles the \"northwest of the Arabian plate\". \n\nThe climate in Syria is dry and hot, and winters are mild. Because of the country's elevation, snowfall does occasionally occur during winter. Petroleum in commercial quantities was first discovered in the northeast in 1956. The most important oil fields are those of Suwaydiyah, Qaratshui, Rumayian, and Tayyem, near Dayr az\u2013Zawr. The fields are a natural extension of the Iraqi fields of Mosul and Kirkuk. Petroleum became Syria's leading natural resource and chief export after 1974. Natural gas was discovered at the field of Jbessa in 1940.\n\nPolitics and government \n\n \n\nSyria is formally a unitary republic. The constitution adopted in 2012 effectively transformed Syria into a semi-presidential republic due to the constitutional right for the election of individuals who do not form part of the National Progressive Front.  The President is Head of State and the Prime Minister is Head of Government.  The legislature, the Peoples Council, is the body responsible for passing laws, approving government appropriations and debating policy.  In the event of a vote of no confidence by a simple majority, the Prime Minister is required to tender the resignation of their government to the President. \n\nThe executive branch consists of the president, two vice presidents, the prime minister, and the Council of Ministers (cabinet). The constitution requires the president to be a Muslim  but does not make Islam the state religion.\nIraq (,, or;  '), officially the Republic of Iraq (Arabic:  ) is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya.  Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Shia or Sunni Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present.\n\nIraq has a coastline measuring 58 km on the northern Persian Gulf and encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain, the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range, and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert.  Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run south through Iraq and into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf. These rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land.\n\nThe region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, historically known as Mesopotamia, is often referred to as the cradle of civilisation. It was here that mankind first began to read, write, create laws, and live in cities under an organised government\u2014notably Uruk, from which \"Iraq\" is derived. The area has been home to successive civilisations since the 6th millennium BC. Iraq was the centre of the Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian empires. It was also part of the Median, Achaemenid, Hellenistic, Parthian, Sassanid, Roman, Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Ayyubid, Mongol, Safavid, Afsharid, and Ottoman empires.",

    "question": "Following success at the 1979 election whose party conference speeech included the lines 'you turn if you want to, the lady's not for turning'?",
    "answer": "Margaret Thatcher",
    "evidence": "The United Kingdom general election of 1979 was held on 3 May 1979 to elect 635 members to the British House of Commons.  The Conservative Party, led by Margaret Thatcher, ousted the incumbent Labour government of James Callaghan with a parliamentary majority of 44 seats.  The election was the first of four consecutive election victories for the Conservative Party, and Thatcher became the United Kingdom and Europe's first female elected head of government.\n\nThe previous parliamentary term had begun in October 1974, when Harold Wilson led Labour to a majority of three seats, but within 18 months he had resigned as prime minister to be succeeded by James Callaghan, and within a year the government's narrow parliamentary majority had gone.  Callaghan had made agreements with the Liberals, the Ulster Unionists, as well as the Scottish and Welsh nationalists in order to remain in power. However, on 28 March 1979 following the defeat of the Scottish devolution referendum, Thatcher tabled a motion of no confidence in James Callaghan's Labour government, which was passed by just one vote (311 to 310), triggering a general election five months before the end of the government's term.\n\nThe Labour campaign was hampered by the series of industrial disputes and strikes during the Winter of 1978-79, known as the Winter of Discontent and the party focused its campaign on support for the National Health Service and full employment. After intense media speculation, Callaghan had announced early in the autumn of 1978 that a general election would not take place that year having received private polling data which suggested a parliamentary majority was unlikely.\n\"The lady's not for turning\" was a phrase used by Margaret Thatcher, then Prime Minister, in her speech to the Conservative Party Conference on 10 October 1980.  The term has thus been applied as a name to the speech in its entirety.  It is considered a defining speech in Thatcher's political development,  becoming something of a Thatcherite motto. \n\nThe phrase made reference to Thatcher's refusal to perform a \"U-turn\" in response to opposition to her liberalisation of the economy, which some commentators and Ted Heath had urged,  mainly because unemployment had risen to 2 million by the autumn of 1980 from 1.5 million the previous year and the economy was in recession,  exceeding 3 million by the time the recession ended in 1982. \n\nIt was written by the playwright Sir Ronald Millar, who had been Thatcher's speech-writer since 1973, and was a pun on the 1948 play The Lady's Not for Burning by Christopher Fry, although Thatcher missed the reference herself.    Millar had intended the \"you turn if you want to\" line, which preceded it, to be the most popular, and it received an ovation itself, but it was \"the lady's not for turning\" that received the headlines. At the time, Thatcher was already being referred to as the \"Iron Lady\".\n\nThe speech as a whole was very warmly received at the conference, and received a five-minute standing ovation.\n\nExcerpt\nTelevision critic Clive James, writing in The Observer during the voting for the leadership, compared her voice of 1973 to a cat sliding down a blackboard. Thatcher had already begun to work on her presentation on the advice of Gordon Reece, a former television producer. By chance Reece met the actor Laurence Olivier, who arranged lessons with the National Theatre's voice coach.  Thatcher succeeded in completely suppressing her Lincolnshire dialect except when under stress, notably after provocation from Denis Healey in the House of Commons in April 1983, when she accused the Labour front bench of being frit.  \n\nOn 19 January 1976 Thatcher made a speech in Kensington Town Hall in which she made a scathing attack on the Soviet Union: \n\nIn response, the Soviet Defence Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) called her the \"Iron Lady,\" a sobriquet she gladly adopted.\n\nMargaret Thatcher wanted to prevent the creation of a Scottish assembly. She told Conservative MPs to vote against the Scotland and Wales Bill in December 1976, which was defeated, and then when new Bills were proposed she supported amending the legislation to allow the English to vote in the 1979 referendum on devolution. \n\nBritain's economy during the 1970s was so weak that Foreign Minister James Callaghan warned his fellow Labour Cabinet members in 1974 of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\" In mid-1978, the economy began to improve and opinion polls showed Labour in the lead, with a general election being expected later that year and a Labour win a serious possibility. Now Prime Minister, Callaghan surprised many by announcing on 7 September that there would be no general election that year and he would wait until 1979 before going to the polls. Thatcher reacted to this by branding the Labour government \"chickens\", and Liberal Party leader David Steel joined in, criticising Labour for \"running scared\".",

    "question": "In the run up to the 1997 election, Tony Blair outlined his parties' three priorities for office, can you name them?",
    "answer": "Education, Education, Education",
    "evidence": "Liberal Democrat campaign\n\nThe Liberal Democrats had suffered a disappointing performance in 1992, but they were very much strengthened in 1997 due to potential tactical voting between Labour and Lib Dem supporters in Tory marginal constituencies, particularly in the south - particularly given their share of the vote decreased whilst their number of seats nearly doubled. The Lib Dems promised to increase education funding.\n\nNational 1992 results\n\nThe election was fought under new boundaries, with a net increase of eight seats compared to the 1992 election (651 to 659). Changes listed here are from the national 1992 result, had it been fought on the boundaries established in 1997. These national results were calculated by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher and were used by all media organisations at the time.\n\n|}\n\nResults\n\nLabour won a landslide victory with their largest parliamentary majority (179) to date. On the BBC's election night programme Professor Anthony King described the result of the exit poll, which accurately predicted a Labour landslide, as being akin to \"an asteroid hitting the planet and destroying practically all life on Earth\". After years of trying the Labour Party had convinced the electorate that they would usher in a new age of prosperity\u2014their policies, organisation and tone of optimism slotting perfectly into place.\nHe inherited the Labour leadership at a time when the party was ascendant over the Tories in the opinion polls since the Tory government's reputation for monetary excellence was left in tatters by the Black Wednesday economic disaster of September 1992. Blair's election as leader saw Labour support surge higher still  in spite of the continuing economic recovery and fall in unemployment that the Conservative government (led by John Major) had overseen since the end of the 1990\u201392 recession. At the 1996 Labour Party conference, Blair stated that his three top priorities on coming to office were \"education, education, and education\". \n\nAided by the unpopularity of John Major's Conservative government (itself deeply divided over the European Union ), \"New Labour\" won a landslide victory in the 1997 general election, ending 18 years of Conservative Party government, with the heaviest Conservative defeat since 1906. \n\nAccording to diaries released by Paddy Ashdown, during Smith's leadership of the Labour Party, there were discussions with Ashdown about forming a coalition government if the next general election resulted in a hung parliament. Ashdown also claimed that Blair was a supporter of proportional representation (PR). In addition to Ashdown, Liberal Democrat MPs Menzies Campbell and Alan Beith were earmarked for places in the cabinet if the coalition was formed. Blair was forced to back down on these proposals because John Prescott and Gordon Brown opposed the PR system, and many members of the shadow cabinet were worried about concessions being made towards the Lib Dems. However, after Blair became leader, these talks continued  \u2013 despite virtually every opinion poll since late 1992 having shown Labour with enough support to form a majority.  However, the scale of the Labour victory meant that there was ultimately never any need for a coalition.\n\nPrime Minister\nOther issues\n\nIn 2000, Brown was accused of starting a political row about higher education (referred to as the Laura Spence Affair) when he accused the University of Oxford of elitism in its admissions procedures, describing its decision not to offer a place to state school pupil Laura Spence as \"absolutely outrageous\".  Lord Jenkins, then Oxford Chancellor and himself a former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, said \"nearly every fact he used was false.\" \n\nBetween 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's gold reserves shortly before gold entered a protracted bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom.   The official reason for selling the gold reserves was to reduce the portfolio risk of the UK's reserves by diversifying away from gold. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5\u00a0billion.  By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised. \n\nAs Chancellor, Brown argued against renationalising the railways, saying at the Labour conference in 2004 that it would cost \u00a322 billion. \n\nDuring his time as Chancellor, Brown reportedly believed that it was appropriate to remove most, but not all, of the unpayable Third World debt.  On 20 April 2006, in a speech to the United Nations Ambassadors, Brown outlined a \"Green\" view of global development. \n\nRun-up to succeeding Tony Blair",

He was part of the fearsome West Indian pace battery, together with Joel Garner, Andy Roberts, Sylvester Clarke, Colin Croft, Wayne Daniel and the late Malcolm Marshall that devastated batting line-ups throughout the world in the seventies and early eighties. Early in his Test career, in 1976, Holding broke the record for best bowling figures in a Test match by a West Indies bowler, 14 wickets for 149 runs (14/149). The record still stands.

Another recurring male character type is the smartly dressed businessman, often involved in gang culture and crime and seen as a local authority figure. Examples include Derek Branning, Steve Owen, Jack Dalton, Andy Hunter and Johnny Allen. Following criticism aimed at the show's over-emphasis on 'gangsters' in 2005, such characters have been significantly reduced.

The original show ran for ten series between 29 October 1979 and 10 March 1994, and starred Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, an honest and likable bodyguard (minder in London slang) and George Cole as Arthur Daley, a socially ambitious, but highly unscrupulous importer-exporter, wholesaler, used-car salesman and purveyor of anything else from which there was money to be made, whether inside the law or not.\n\nThe series was principally set in inner West London (Shepherd's Bush/Ladbroke Grove/Fulham/Acton), and was largely responsible for putting the word minder, meaning personal bodyguard, into the UK popular lexicon. The characters often drank at the local members-only Winchester Club, where owner and barman Dave (Glynn Edwards) acted, often unwillingly, as a message machine for Arthur, and turned a blind eye to his shady deals. The series was notable for using a range of leading British actors, as well as many up-and-coming performers before they hit the big time; at its peak was one of ITV's biggest ratings winners.\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that Minder would go into production for broadcast in 2009 (on Channel 5) for a new version, though none of the original cast would appear in the new episodes.

    "question": "Which comedy written by Johnny Speight which first aired in 1965, featured a fervent West Ham supporter?",
    "answer": "Till Death Us Do Part",
    "evidence": "Johnny Speight (2 June 1920 \u2013 5 July 1998) was a British television scriptwriter of many classic British sitcoms.\n\nHe emerged in the mid-1950s. He wrote for radio comics Frankie Howerd, Vic Oliver, Arthur Askey, and Cyril Fletcher. For television he wrote for Morecambe & Wise, and Peter Sellers, as well as The Arthur Haynes Show.  Later, he began to write Till Death Us Do Part, which included his most famous creation, the controversial bigot Alf Garnett. His shows often explored the themes of racism and sexism through satire.\n\nLife and career\n\nJohn Speight was born at 57 Chester Rd Canning Town,  West Ham, Essex (now Greater London), and began contributing scripts to comedy shows in 1955, starting with Great Scott - It's Maynard!. He later contributed to Sykes And A... (1960\u201365), which starred Eric Sykes, Hattie Jacques and Richard Wattis. Speight was one of many writing talents on that series which also included the star Sykes, John Antrobus and Spike Milligan. He created the iconic working class tramp figure played by Arthur Haynes in the latter's long-running and top-rating ATV comedy series. Haynes died in 1966. \n\nIn 1965, Speight wrote a BBC TV pilot which became the 1966 series Till Death Us Do Part featuring Warren Mitchell as Alf Garnett, a reactionary Conservative-voting working class man with a chip on his shoulder and an angry word on everything. Garnett became one of the most memorable characters in British TV history, despite being such an appalling figure. The 1971 US sitcom All in the Family was based on this series. It was during the production of Till Death Us Do Part that a BBC bureaucrat, according to legend, attempted to talk Speight into ameliorating his script by bargaining the number of occurrences of \"damn\", \"bloody\" and other words held to be offensive. The incident became the basis for a satirical sketch performed by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, with Cook as the bureaucrat and Moore as a scriptwriter named \"Johnny\".\nTill Death Us Do Part is a British television sitcom that aired on BBC1 from 1965 to 1975. First airing as a Comedy Playhouse pilot, the show aired in seven series until 1975. Six years later, ITV continued the sitcom, calling it Till Death.... From 1985 to 1992, the BBC produced a sequel In Sickness and in Health.\n\nCreated by Johnny Speight, Till Death Us Do Part centred on the East End Garnett family, led by patriarch Alf Garnett (Warren Mitchell), a reactionary white working-class man who holds racist and anti-socialist views. His long-suffering wife Else was played by Dandy Nichols, and his daughter Rita by Una Stubbs. Rita's husband Mike Rawlins (Anthony Booth) is a socialist layabout. The character Alf Garnett became a well known character in British culture, and Mitchell played him on stage and television up until Speight's death in 1998.\n\nIn addition to the spin-off In Sickness and in Health, Till Death Us Do Part was re-made in many countries including Brazil, Germany (Ein Herz und eine Seele), the Netherlands (In Voor- En Tegenspoed), and is known to the United States as the show that inspired All in the Family.\n\nMany episodes from the first three series are thought to no longer exist, having been wiped in the late 1960s and early '70s as was the policy at the time.\n\nSeries \n\nSuccess years",

    "answer": "Steptoe and Son",
    "evidence": "Ray Galton OBE (born 17 July 1930), and Alan Simpson OBE (born 27 November 1929), are British scriptwriters. They met in 1948 whilst recuperating from tuberculosis at the Milford sanatorium, near Godalming in Surrey. They based the sitcom Get Well Soon on their shared experiences at the facility. They are best known for their work with comedian Tony Hancock on radio and television between 1954 and 1961, and their long-running television situation comedy, Steptoe and Son, eight series of which were aired between 1962 and 1974. \n\nCareer\n\nThe partnership's break in comedy writing came with the Derek Roy vehicle Happy Go Lucky, although this was not a success.  The Hancock connection began with their involvement with later radio variety series, and from November 1954 continued with Hancock's Half Hour on radio; a series featuring their scripts for Hancock ran on television between 1956 and 1961. In October that year Hancock ended his professional relationship with the writers, and with Beryl Vertue who worked with the writers' at their agency Associated London Scripts. This writers' co-operative had been founded by Eric Sykes and Spike Milligan, with others involved, including Hancock for a time. \n\nAfter their association with Hancock had ended, they wrote a series of Comedy Playhouse (1961\u201362), ten one-off half-hour plays for the BBC. One play in the series, The Offer, was well received, and from this emerged Steptoe and Son (1962\u201374), about two rag and bone men, father and son, who live together in a squalid house in West London. This was the basis for the American series Sanford and Son and the Swedish series Albert & Herbert.",

    "evidence": "Andrew Bonar Law (16 September 1858\u00a0\u2013 30 October 1923), commonly called Bonar Law (,),  was a British Conservative Party statesman and Prime Minister. Born in the colony of New Brunswick (now in Canada), he is the only British Prime Minister to have been born outside the British Isles. \n\nLaw was of Scottish and Ulster Scots descent, and having moved back to Scotland in 1870, he left school aged sixteen to work in the iron industry, becoming a wealthy man by the age of thirty. He entered Parliament at the 1900 general election, relatively late in life for a front-rank politician, and was made a junior minister, Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, in 1902. Law joined the Shadow Cabinet in opposition after the  1906 election. In 1911 he  was appointed a Privy Councillor, and stood for the vacant party leadership. Despite never having served in the Cabinet, and despite trailing third after Walter Long and Austen Chamberlain, Law became leader when the two frontrunners withdrew rather than risk a draw splitting the party.\n\nAs Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition, Law focused his attentions in favour of tariff reform and against Irish Home Rule. His campaigning helped turn Liberal attempts to pass the Third Home Rule Bill into a three-year struggle eventually halted by the start of the First World War, with much argument over the status of the six predominantly Protestant counties which would later become Northern Ireland.",

A. Milne. The wood is visited regularly by the young boy Christopher Robin, who accompanies Pooh and company on their many adventures.\n\nIn A. A. Milne's books, the term \"Hundred Acre Wood\" is actually used for a specific part of the larger Forest, centred on Owl's house (see the map in the book, as well as numerous references in the text to the characters going \"into\" or \"out of\" the Hundred Acre Wood as they go between Owl's house and other Forest locations).  However, in the Pooh movies, and in general conversation with most Pooh fans, \"The Hundred Acre Wood\" is used for the entire world of Winnie-the-Pooh, the Forest and all the places it contains.\n\nThe Hundred Acre Wood of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories is in actuality Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, England, where the Winnie-the-Pooh stories were set. A.A. Milne's country home at Cotchford Farm, Hartfield was situated just north of Ashdown Forest, and Five Hundred Acre Wood is a dense beech wood that Christopher Robin Milne would explore on his way from Cotchford Farm onto the Forest. Five Hundred Acre wood is long-established, having been originally sold off from the Forest in 1678. The wood remains privately owned, being part of Buckhurst Park,  and is not therefore generally accessible to the public, though two footpaths which are public rights of way, one of which is part of a long-distance footpath, the Wealdway, cross through the wood and may be used by members of the public.",

As a German teenager, Becker won the Tennis World Young Masters at the NEC in Birmingham in 1985, before taking his first top-level singles title in June that year at Queen's Club. Two weeks later, on 7 July, he became the first unseeded player and the first German to win the Wimbledon singles title, defeating Kevin Curren in four sets. Unseeded, Becker was at that time ranked 20th in ATP ranking,  but Wimbledon did not then seed players beyond the top 16. He was the youngest ever male Grand Slam singles champion at  (a record later broken by Michael Chang in 1989, who won the French Open when he was ). Two months after his triumph, Becker became the youngest winner of the Cincinnati Open. Becker has since said that \"The plan from my parents for me was to finish school, go to university, get a proper degree and learn something respectful. The last thing on everyone's mind was me becoming a tennis professional.\" \n\nIn 1986, Becker successfully defended his Wimbledon title, defeating world no. 1 Ivan Lendl in straight sets in the final. In 1987 Becker, then ranked world no. 2, was upset in the second round of Wimbledon by the world no. 70 player, Peter Doohan. In the Davis Cup that year, Becker and John McEnroe played one of the longest matches in tennis history. Becker won 4\u20136, 15\u201313, 8\u201310, 6\u20132, 6\u20132 (at that time, there were no tiebreaks in the Davis Cup).

    "question": "How many times did Steffi Graf win the Ladies Singles at Wimbledon?",
    "answer": "7",
    "evidence": "On 13 April 1986, Graf won her first WTA tournament and beat Evert for the first time in the final of the Family Circle Cup in Hilton Head, South Carolina. (She never lost to Evert again, beating her a further seven times over the next three and a half years.) Graf then won her next three tournaments at Amelia Island, Charleston, and Berlin, culminating in a 6\u20132, 6\u20133 defeat of Navratilova in the final of the latter. Illness caused her to miss Wimbledon,  and an accident where she broke a toe several weeks later also curtailed her play. She returned to win a small tournament at Mahwah just before the US Open where, in one of the most anticipated matches of the year, she encountered Navratilova in a semifinal. The match was played over two days with Navratilova finally winning after saving three match points 6\u20131, 6\u20137, 7\u20136. Graf then won three consecutive indoor titles at Tokyo, Z\u00fcrich, and Brighton, before once again contending with Navratilova at the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships in New York City. This time, Navratilova beat Graf 7\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20132.\n\nBreakthrough year: 1987 \n\nGraf's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came in 1987. She started the year strongly, with six tournament victories heading into the French Open, the highlight being at the tournament in Miami, where she defeated Martina Navratilova in a semifinal and Chris Evert in the final and conceded only 20 games in the seven rounds of the tournament. In the French Open final, Graf defeated Martina, who was the World No. 1, 6\u20134, 4\u20136, 8\u20136 after beating Sabatini in a three-set semifinal.\n\nGraf then lost to Navratilova 7\u20135, 6\u20133 in the Wimbledon final, her first loss of the year. However, in the Federation Cup final in Vancouver, Canada, three weeks later, she defeated Evert easily 6\u20132, 6\u20131. The US Open ended anti-climactically as Navratilova defeated Graf in the final 7\u20136, 6\u20131.\nPetra Kvitov\u00e1 was the defending champion, but lost to Serena Williams in the quarterfinals. Williams went on to win the tournament, beating Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska in the final, 6\u20131, 5\u20137, 6\u20132.\n\nYaroslava Shvedova became the first player in the Open Era to win a 'Golden Set' at Wimbledon, winning the first set of her 6\u20130, 6\u20134 victory over 2012 French Open runner-up Sara Errani in the third round without dropping a single point. \n\nSabine Lisicki defeated the reigning French Open champion for her third straight Wimbledon.

    "evidence": "* While performing their 1982 hit \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\", the band Dexy's Midnight Runners were seen performing in front of a projection of the darts player Jocky Wilson instead of soul singer Jackie Wilson.  Dexy's frontman Kevin Rowland later said in an interview that the use of the Jocky Wilson picture was his idea and not a mistake by the programme makers as is sometimes stated.  \n* Frankie Goes To Hollywood performed one of the many 1984 performances of their hit \"Two Tribes\" with bassist Mark O'Toole playing drums whilst drummer Ped Gill played bass.\n* After The Bluebells' hit \"Young at Heart\" unexpectedly reached number one in 1993, nine years after the song's original release, the band reunited after having spent many years disbanded to play the song several times on the show where they parodied various other famous acts of the time such as Shabba Ranks and 2 Unlimited, one performance including lead singer Ken McCluskey pretending to play or scratch records on a \"Bluebells Disco\" DJ deck erected in front of the stage. The performance from 25 March is also remembered for an unusual camera technique where a camera was fixed to the bow of the violinist, Bobby Valentino, leading to several fast and humorous shots of the bow being used.\n* When Oasis mimed to \"Whatever\" on Top of the Pops in 1994, one of the cello players from the symphony was replaced by rhythm guitarist Bonehead, who clearly had no idea how the instrument should be played. Towards the end of the song, he gave up the pretence and started using the bow to conduct. A woman plays his rhythm guitar.  On another occasion Liam walked away from the microphone and chewed gum during a 2005 performance of \"Lyla\".\nCareer\n\nDexys Mark I: 1978\u201380\n\nFoundation and first single \n\nAfter the breakup of their previous band the Killjoys, Kevin Rowland (vocals, guitar, at the time going under the pseudonym Carlo Rolan)  and Kevin \"Al\" Archer (vocals, guitar) founded the band in 1978 in Birmingham, England.  Rowland had previously written a Northern Soul-style song that the two of them sang, \"Tell Me When My Light Turns Green\", which became the first Dexys \"song\",  and they then named the band after Dexedrine, a brand of dextroamphetamine popularly used as a recreational drug among Northern Soul fans at the time. The \"midnight runners\" referred to the energy the Dexedrine gave, enabling one to dance all night.  While recruiting members for the new band, Rowland noted that \"Anyone joining Dexys had to give up their job and rehearse all day long. . . . We had nothing to lose and felt that what we were doing was everything.\" \"Big\" Jim Paterson (trombone), Geoff \"JB\" Blythe (saxophone, previously of Geno Washington's Ram Jam Band), Steve \"Babyface\" Spooner (alto saxophone), Pete Saunders (keyboard), Pete Williams (bass) and John Jay (drums) formed the first line-up of the band, which began playing live at the end of 1978. \n\nBy summer 1979, Bobby \"Jnr\" Ward replaced Jay on drums.  Clash manager Bernard Rhodes then signed them and sent them into the studio to record a Rowland-penned single, \"Burn It Down\", which Rhodes renamed to \"Dance Stance\".  In response to Rhodes' criticism of Rowland's singing style, Rowland developed a \"more emotional\" sound, influenced by General Johnson of the Holland-Dozier-Holland band The Chairmen of the Board, as well as the theatricality of Bryan Ferry.",

    "evidence": "Spoofs\n\nDavid Tennant has also made numerous cameo appearances as the Doctor outside of Doctor Who, frequently in spoof appearances. Singer and actress Charlotte Church spoofs Doctor Who alongside an actor playing the Tenth Doctor in her own The Charlotte Church Show (2006). In an appearance on The Friday Night Project in 2007, Tennant plays a female companion to the Tenth Doctor (Justin Lee Collins) on the Pink Planet, where they are confronted by the alien Gay Lord (Alan Carr). When the show became The Sunday Night Project, Catherine Tate appeared in a skit playing the Tenth Doctor. Tennant starred opposite Catherine Tate in her own The Catherine Tate Show special (2007) as Lauren Cooper's (Tate) teacher Mr. Logan, who Cooper teases for his resemblance to the Doctor; eventually, he reveals himself to be the Tenth Doctor and shrinks Cooper into a 5\" Rose Tyler action figure. In the final episode of Extras (December 2007), a brief scene shows the Doctor and an unidentified Wren companion attacked by Schlong, a slug-like alien played by Andy Millman (Ricky Gervais). The Tenth Doctor is also featured in political satire; in a 2007 episode of Dead Ringers, when faced by the question of Gordon Brown's succession, Tony Blair (impressionist Jon Culshaw) regenerates into David Tennant after promising \"New Labour is all about renewal\", later vowing 100 more years of power. Tennant modifies his first line in \"The Parting of the Ways\" (\"New teeth, that's weird\"), to \"New Labour, that's weird\" and proceeds to address the public in a Tony Blair impression resembling Culshaw's. Tennant also guest voiced his incarnation of the Doctor in an episode of Family Guy.\n\nLiterature\nMeetings of different incarnations\n\nThere have been instances of actors returning at later dates to reprise the role of their specific Doctor. In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.  In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in \"Father's Day\", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in \"The Big Bang\". In \"The Almost People\" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In \"The Name of the Doctor\", the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as \"his secret\" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor.",

    "question": "How many Rings of Power were there, in total?",
    "answer": "20",
    "evidence": "Sauron returned to Mordor, and in his forge in Mount Doom he made the One Ring, imbuing it with a large portion of his power. Its purpose was domination over the other Rings and their powers, and the opening of the thoughts and wills of their wearers to his view and control. However, when Sauron put on the One Ring and recited the formula inscribed on it:\n\nBlack Speech:\n\nEnglish:\n\nThe Elves became aware of him and understood who he was and his purpose. They immediately took off the Three and hid them without using them.  Sauron invaded the West to recover the rings that the Elves had made, and much of the West, including Eregion, was destroyed before he was driven back to Mordor. Sauron recovered the Nine and the Seven, but not the Three, which remained hidden.\n\nThe Verse of the Rings\n\nThe words inscribed on the One Ring come from the following verse, which describes 20 of the Rings of Power:\n\nThe Nine\n\nLater in the Second Age, Sauron gave the Nine to powerful men, \"kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old\".  Only two of the bearers of the nine rings are identified individually. Their leader would later become the Witch-king of Angmar, and his second in command was named Kham\u00fbl, an Easterling.  Kham\u00fbl was the only one to be named. Three of the Nine were N\u00famen\u00f3rean.  All Nine would fall under the rings' domination, and they became the Nazg\u00fbl (Ringwraiths): spirits of terror whom Sauron could command even without the One. Their lives were extended indefinitely by the rings, and they became Sauron's chief servants, especially during the first part of the Third Age when he was too weak to act on his own behalf.\n\nAny of these Rings of Power seemed to render a man who wore it invisible. The Nazg\u00fbl could not be seen directly by mortal eyes, but wore dark cloaks to give themselves form. Frodo saw their true form when he put on the One Ring on Weathertop.\nThe Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold. \n\nThe title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise \"Sam\" Gamgee, Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck and Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took, but also the hobbits' chief allies and travelling companions: the Men Aragorn son of Arathorn, a Ranger of the North, and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli son of Gl\u00f3in, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas Greenleaf, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a Wizard.\n\nThe work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set, the other to be The Silmarillion, but this idea was dismissed by his publisher.   For economic reasons The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955.  The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. Structurally, the novel is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume. Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume.  The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages.",

    "question": "Which golf shot is the opposite of a slice?",
    "answer": "Hook",
    "evidence": "Having chosen a club and stroke to produce the desired distance, the player addresses the ball by taking their stance to the side of it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club behind the ball. The golfer then takes their backswing, rotating the club, their arms and their upper body away from the ball, and then begins their swing, bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball. A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions, and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels. The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single \"plane\" of motion of the club and clubhead, to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction.\n\nAccuracy and consistency is typically stressed over pure distance. A player with a straight drive that travels only 220 yd will nevertheless be able to accurately place the ball into a favourable lie on the fairway, and can make up for the lesser distance of any given club by simply using \"more club\" (a lower loft) on their tee shot or on subsequent fairway and approach shots. However, a golfer with a drive that may go 280 yd but often doesn't fly straight will be less able to position their ball advantageously; the ball may \"hook\", \"pull\", \"draw\", \"fade\", \"push\" or \"slice\" off the intended line and land out of bounds or in the rough or hazards, and thus the player will require many more strokes to hole out.\n\nMusculature",

    "question": "Which actress left Eastenders for Hollywood only to flop as The Bionic Woman?",
    "answer": "Michelle Ryan",
    "evidence": "The French comic T\u00e9l\u00e9-Junior published strips based on popular TV series. This included their own versions of The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman which was renamed Super Jaimie.\n\nIn March 2012, Dynamite Entertainment launched a new The Bionic Woman comic book title, based upon the revised continuity established in the Kevin Smith-written The Bionic Man comic (a reimagining of The Six Million Dollar Man), in which the character of Jaime Sommers was reintroduced.  A crossover mini-series, The Bionic Man vs. The Bionic Woman, was launched in January 2013. Unlike the Bionic Man title, which (depending on the artist) occasionally renders Steve Austin in the likeness of actor Lee Majors, the Dynamite version of Jaime Sommers generally is not rendered in the likeness of Lindsay Wagner. In late 2013, Dynamite ended both series and in the spring of 2014 launched The Six Million Dollar Man Season 6, a more faithful adaptation of the original Six Million Dollar Man TV series. Jaime Sommers, based on the Wagner interpretation, was reintroduced in issue 3 and in June 2014 Dynamite announced it will publish The Bionic Woman Season 4, a continuation of the TV series, beginning in the fall of 2014.\n\nMerchandise\n\nLike its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a 12-inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version (bionic modules and removable bionic limbs), except instead of a bionic eye the doll's head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaime's bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset.\n\nA metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers individually and with Steve Austin.",

    "question": "In Only Fools And Horses, Rodney Trotter shares his middle name with which London football club?",
    "answer": "Charlton",
    "evidence": "In later episodes, the only thing that troubled Rodney was his nephew Damien, whom he had recurring nightmares about. He was convinced that he was going to be the son of Satan, being named Damien did not help matters at all, (even though it was Rodney's bright idea that he was named Damien in the first place). The fact that Trigger had been calling him \"Dave\" since 1981 was no help. He did not know that Rodney was called Rodney, he always called him \"Dave\". No matter how many opportunities Trigger had to realise that \"Dave\" was not Rodney's name, he continued to call him Dave. One instance was in \"Three Men, a Woman and a Baby\", Rodney tells Trigger that if Del and Raquel's baby is a boy, they will name it Rodney after him. Trigger then tells Mike (who is holding a \"Guess the baby name\" competition) that \"If it's a boy, they're naming it Rodney, after Dave\".  Another instance was portrayed in \"Modern Men\", when Mike (the landlord at the Nags Head pub), announced a toast to future Mum and Dad \"Cassandra and Rodney\"; everyone said \"Cassandra and Rodney\", but Trigger could be heard shouting \"Dave\" after everyone else stops talking. In \"Homesick (Only Fools and Horses)\", Rodney did tell Trigger in his face that his name was \"Rodney\" and not \"Dave\",  yet despite this he continues to address him as 'Dave' and even refers to him as this, when he is not around. \n\nCassandra fell pregnant in \"Heroes and Villains\", but later miscarried in \"Modern Men\"\n\nIt is implied in some episodes that Rodney is a Chelsea supporter. In The Long Legs of the Law Del remarks that ICI have dropped a point, to which Rodney replies that \"Chelsea dropped 3 on Saturday!\" In a later episode, A Royal Flush, he takes Victoria to see a football match at Stamford Bridge.\n\nFamily\nSport\n\nLondon has hosted the Summer Olympics three times: in 1908, 1948, and 2012. It was chosen in July 2005 to host the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, making it the first city to host the modern Games three times. The city was also the host of the British Empire Games in 1934. In 2017 London will host the World Championships in Athletics. \n\nLondon's most popular sport is football and it has fourteen Football League clubs, including five in the Premier League: Arsenal, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Tottenham Hotspur, and West Ham United. Other professional teams in London are Fulham, Queens Park Rangers, Brentford, Millwall, Charlton Athletic, AFC Wimbledon, Barnet and Leyton Orient. In 2012, Chelsea became the first London club to win the UEFA Champions League. Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham are the only London clubs to have won the League.\n\nFrom 1924, the original Wembley Stadium was the home of the English national football team.\nIt hosted the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, with England defeating West Germany, and served as the venue for the FA Cup Final as well as rugby league's Challenge Cup final. The new Wembley Stadium serves exactly the same purposes and has a capacity of 90,000. \n\nThree Aviva Premiership rugby union teams are based in London, (London Irish, Saracens,  and Harlequins), although currently only Harlequins and Saracens play their home games within Greater London. London Scottish and London Welsh  play in the RFU Championship club and other rugby union clubs in the city include Richmond F.C., Rosslyn Park F.C., Westcombe Park R.F.C. and Blackheath F.C..

    "question": "How were Dr Stantz, Dr Spengler and Dr Venkman better known in the 1980's?",
    "answer": "Ghostbusters",
    "evidence": "Plot\n\nParapsychologists Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz, and Egon Spengler are called to the New York Public Library to investigate recent paranormal activity. They encounter the ghost of a dead librarian but are frightened away when she transforms into a horrifying monster. After losing their jobs at Columbia University, the trio establish a paranormal investigation and extermination service known as \"Ghostbusters\". They develop high-tech equipment capable of capturing ghosts and open their business in a disused, run-down firehouse. Egon warns them never to cross the energy streams of their proton pack weapons, as this could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture their first ghost, Slimer, at a hotel and deposit it in a specially built containment unit in the firehouse basement. As paranormal activity increases in New York City, they hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore, to cope with demand.\n\nThe Ghostbusters are retained by cellist Dana Barrett, whose apartment is haunted by a demonic spirit, Zuul, a demigod worshiped as a servant to Gozer the Gozerian, a Sumerian shape-shifting god of destruction. Venkman takes a particular interest in the case, and competes with Dana's neighbor, accountant Louis Tully, for her affection. As the Ghostbusters investigate, Dana is demonically possessed by Zuul, which declares itself the \"Gatekeeper\", and Louis by a similar demon, Vinz Clortho, the \"Keymaster\". Both demons speak of the coming of the destructive Gozer and the release of the imprisoned ghosts, and the Ghostbusters take steps to keep the two apart.",

    "question": "General Charles de Gaulle was French President 1959 to 1969. Who succeeded him?",
    "answer": "Georges Pompidou",
    "evidence": "But de Gaulle offered to accept some of the reforms the demonstrators sought. He again considered a referendum to support his moves, but on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded him to dissolve parliament (in which the government had all but lost its majority in the March 1967 elections) and hold new elections instead. The June 1968 elections were a major success for the Gaullists and their allies; when shown the spectre of revolution or civil war, the majority of the country rallied to him. His party won 352 of 487 seats,  but de Gaulle remained personally unpopular; a survey conducted immediately after the crisis showed that a majority of the country saw him as too old, too self-centered, too authoritarian, too conservative, and too anti-American.\n\nRetirement\n\nDe Gaulle resigned the presidency at noon, 28 April 1969,   following the rejection of his proposed reform of the Senate and local governments in a nationwide referendum. In an eight-minute televised speech two days before the referendum,  De Gaulle warned that if he was \"disavowed\" by a majority of the voters, he would resign his office immediately. This ultimatum, coupled with increased de Gaulle fatigue among the French convinced many that this was an opportunity to be rid of the 78-year-old general and the reform package was rejected. Two months later Georges Pompidou was elected as his successor.\nCriminal responsibility and impeachment\n\nArticles 67 and 68 organize the regime of criminal responsibility of the President. They were reformed by a 2007 constitutional act,. in order to clarify a situation that previously resulted in legal controversies. \n\nThe President of the Republic enjoys immunity during his term: he cannot be requested to testify before any jurisdiction, he cannot be prosecuted, etc. However, the statute of limitation is suspended during his term, and enquiries and prosecutions can be restarted, at the latest one month after he leaves office.\n\nThe President is not deemed personally responsible for his actions in his official capacity, except where his actions are indicted before the International Criminal Court or where impeachment is moved against him. Impeachment can be pronounced by the High Court, a special court convened from both houses of Parliament on the proposal of either House, should the president have failed to discharge his duties in a way that evidently precludes the continuation of his term.\n\nSuccession and incapacity\n\nUpon the death, removal, or resignation of the President, the President of the Senate takes over as acting president.  Alain Poher is the only person to have served in this temporary position twice: the first time in 1969 after Charles de Gaulle's resignation and a second time in 1974 after Georges Pompidou's death. In this situation, the President of the Senate becomes Acting President of the Republic; he or she does not become the new President of the Republic as elected and therefore does not have to resign from his or her position as President of the Senate. In spite of his title as Acting President of the Republic, Poher is regarded in France as a former President and is listed in the presidents' gallery on [http://www.elysee.fr the official presidential website]. This is in contrast to acting presidents from the Third Republic.",

    "question": "What is the name of the enzyme usually added to milk to coagulate it, to make \"curds and whey\"?",
    "answer": "Rennet.",
    "evidence": "In Turkey, curds are called ke\u015f and are very commonly used as an aphrodisiac and for breakfast served on fried bread and are also eaten with macaroni in the provinces of Bolu and Zonguldak.\n\nIn Mexico, the chongos zamoranos is a dessert prepared with milk curdled with sugar and cinnamon.\n\nAlbanian gjiza is made by boiling whey for about 15 minutes and adding vinegar or lemon. The derivative is drained 3 to 4 times with a napkin or piece of cloth and salted to taste. Gjiza can be served immediately or refrigerated for a couple of days.\n\nFormation\n\nLactobacillus is a genus of bacteria which can convert sugars into lactic acid by means of fermentation. Milk contains a sugar called lactose, a disaccharide (compound sugar) made by the glycosidic bonding between glucose and galactose (monosaccharides). When pasteurized milk is heated to a temperature of 30-40\u00a0\u00b0C, or even at room temperature or refrigerator temperature, and a small amount of old curd or whey added to it, the lactobacillus in that curd or whey sample starts to grow. These convert the lactose into lactic acid, which imparts the sour taste to curd. Raw milk naturally contains lactobacillus.\n\nCurds in song and poetry\n\nCurds are mentioned in the Middle Irish parodic tale Aislinge Meic Con Glinne (The Vision of Mac Conglinne), the relevant portion of which reads:Stately, pleasantly it sat,A compact house and strong.Then I went in:The door of it was dry meat,The threshold was bare bread,cheese-curds the sides.Smooth pillars of old cheese,And sappy bacon propsAlternate ranged;Fine beams of mellow cream,White rafters - real curds,Kept up the house. \n\nCurds also appear in the nursery rhyme Little Miss Muffet.\nWhey is the liquid remaining after milk has been curdled and strained. It is a co-product of the manufacture of cheese or casein and has several commercial uses. Sweet whey is manufactured during the making of rennet types of hard cheese like cheddar or Swiss cheese. Acid whey (also known as \"sour whey\") is a co-product produced during the making of acid types of dairy products such as cottage cheese or strained yogurt.\n\nWhey proteins consist of \u03b1-lactalbumin, \u03b2-lactoglobulin, serum albumin, immunoglobulins, and a proteose-peptones. \n\nProduction \n\nTo produce cheese, rennet or an edible acid is added to heated milk. This makes the milk coagulate or curdle, separating the milk solids (curds) from the liquid whey. Sweet whey is the co-product of rennet-coagulated cheese and acid whey (also called sour whey) is the co-product of acid-coagulated cheese. Sweet whey has a pH greater than or equal to 5.6, acid whey has a pH less than or equal to 5.1.\n\nUses \n\nWhey is used to produce whey cheeses such as ricotta, whey butter, so-called brown cheeses such as Brunost (technically not cheeses at all), and many other products for human consumption. The fat content of whey is low; for example 1,000\u00a0kg of whey are required to make typically 1\u00a0kg of whey butter.[https://archive.org/stream/CAT31283652/circbai161_djvu.txt C.F. Doane, \"Whey Butter\", Bureau of Animal Industry, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Circular 161 [full text], 23 June 1910.] It is also an additive in many processed foods, including breads, crackers, and commercial pastry, and in animal feed. Whey proteins consist primarily of \u03b1-lactalbumin and \u03b2-lactoglobulin. Depending on the method of manufacture, whey may also contain glycomacropeptides (GMP).\n\nDairy whey remaining from home-made cheesemaking has many uses.  It is a flour conditioner and can be substituted for skim milk in most baked good recipes that require milk (bread, pancakes, muffins, etc.).\nRennet is a complex of enzymes produced in the stomachs of ruminant mammals.  Chymosin, its key component, is a protease enzyme that curdles the casein in milk.  This helps young mammals digest their mothers' milk. Rennet can also be used to separate milk into solid curds for cheesemaking and liquid whey.  In addition to chymosin, rennet contains other important enzymes such as pepsin and a lipase.\n\nRennet is used in the production of most cheeses. The mammal's digestive system must be accessed to obtain its rennet. Non-animal alternatives for rennet are suitable for consumption by vegetarians.\n\nExtraction of calf rennet\n\nCalf rennet is extracted from the inner mucosa of the fourth stomach chamber (the abomasum) of young, unweaned calves as part of livestock butchering. These stomachs are a byproduct of veal production. If rennet is extracted from older calves (grass-fed or grain-fed), the rennet contains less or no chymosin, but a high level of pepsin and can only be used for special types of milk and cheeses. As each ruminant produces a special kind of rennet to digest the milk of its own species, milk-specific rennets are available, such as kid goat rennet for goat's milk and lamb rennet for sheep's milk.\n\nTraditional method \n\nDried and cleaned stomachs of young calves are sliced into small pieces and then put into salt water or whey, together with some vinegar or wine to lower the pH of the solution. After some time (overnight or several days), the solution is filtered. The crude rennet that remains in the filtered solution can then be used to coagulate milk.  About 1\u00a0g of this solution can normally coagulate 2 to 4 L of milk.\n\nModern method",
